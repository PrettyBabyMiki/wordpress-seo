## Unreleased

### Backwards incompatible changes



## 1.1: March 1st, 2016

### Backwards incompatible changes

* Passing the title, url and meta description meant for the snippet editor is no longer taken into account. The snippet
editor keeps track of these values itself.
* `callbacks.updateSnippetValues` has been deprecated in favor of `callback.saveSnippetData`. Currently a raw event is
passed to `updateSnippetValues`. This is undesirable because it couples the callback to the DOM. The new
`saveSnippetData` passes the actual data that the user put in the fields.
* The `SnippetPreview` object now requires an options object instead of an `App` object. The `App` object should still be passed inside the options object with the `analyzerApp` key.
* Removed `SnippetPreview` methods:
	* `setFocus`
	* `hideEditIcon`
	* `showEditIcon`
	* `textFeedback` 
	* `disableEnter`
* Removed `App` methods:
	* `bindSnippetEvents`
	* `bindEvent`
	* `createEditIcon`
	* `createSnippetPreviewEditIcon`
	* `createSnippetPreviewMeta`
	* `createSnippetPreviewUrl`
	* `createSnippetPreviewTitle`
* Deprecated `App.createSnippetPreview`
* Removed `StringHelper` prototype.
* Removed `PreProcessor` prototype.

### Features

* Completely redesign the snippet editor editing experience:
	* Remove the contenteditable fields
	* Add a decoupled form to edit the title, slug and meta description fields.
	* Add a button to clearly show how to open the snippet editor.
	* Add headings to clearly indicate which part is the snippet preview and which is the editor.
	* Add progress bars to show an indication about the length of the title and meta description.
	* Add carets before the preview and form fields to show which preview belongs to which input field.
* Introduce modules. All non-trivial modules are moved out of `analyzer.js` and moved to the `analyses` folder as module. Where it makes sense we added a `stringProcessing` folder with all the string helper modules.
* Introduces new SnippetPreview functions:
	* toggleEditor
	* closeEditor
	* openEditor
	* updateDataFromDOM
	* changedInput
	* bindEvents
	* updateProgressBars
	* validateFields
	* callRegisteredEventBinder
	* getAnalyzerData
	* refresh
	* renderTemplate
* Introduce `ScoreFormatter.getUndefinedScores` to retrieve all the undefined scores from a scores array.
* Introduce `missingArgument` error that is thrown when an argument is missing in the `App`.
* Massively reduce the required config of the `App`.

### Enhancements

* Start to decouple the SnippetPreview from the scrapers and the analyzer.
* Depend on lodash to improve the readability of our codebase and to standardize certain actions.
* Add an option to the `SnippetPreview` to include a date before the meta description.
* Add a `baseURL` option to the `SnippetPreview` to change the base URL.
* Change the stopwords check to a grey bullet that doesn't count towards the total score.

### Bugfixes

* By default add a trailing slash to the rendered URL, add an option to the `SnippetPreview` to disable this behaviour.
* Show the protocol in the snippet preview if it is HTTPS. Google has this behaviour as well.
* Color the meta description preview gray if the user hasn't set it explicitly.
