Models
======

Model classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should create a model class for each entity in your application. For
example, if you are building an application that requires users, you
should create a ``User`` class. Your model classes should extend the
base ``Model`` class:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
    }

Paris takes care of creating instances of your model classes, and
populating them with *data* from the database. You can then add
*behaviour* to this class in the form of public methods which implement
your application logic. This combination of data and behaviour is the
essence of the `Active Record pattern`_.

IDE Auto-complete
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As Paris does not require you to specify a method/function per database column
it can be difficult to know what properties are available on a particular model.
Due to the magic nature of PHP's `__get()`_ method it is impossible for an IDE
to give you autocomplete hints as well.

To work around this you can use PHPDoc comment blocks to list the properties of
the model. These properties should mirror the names of your database tables
columns.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    /**
     * @property int $id
     * @property string $first_name
     * @property string $last_name
     * @property string $email
     */
    class User extends Model {
    }

For more information please see the `PHPDoc manual @property`_ documentation.

Database tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your ``User`` class should have a corresponding ``user`` table in your
database to store its data.

By default, Paris assumes your class names are in *CapWords* style, and
your table names are in *lowercase\_with\_underscores* style. It will
convert between the two automatically. For example, if your class is
called ``CarTyre``, Paris will look for a table named ``car_tyre``.

If you are using namespaces then they will be converted to a table name
in a similar way. For example ``\Models\CarTyre`` would be converted to
``models_car_tyre``. Note here that backslashes are replaced with underscores
in addition to the *CapWords* replacement discussed in the previous paragraph.

To disregard namespace information when calculating the table name, set
``Model::$short_table_names = true;``. Optionally this may be set or overridden at
class level with the **public static** property ``$_table_use_short_name``. The

``$_table_use_short_name`` takes precedence over ``Model::$short_table_names``
unless ``$_table_use_short_name`` is ``null`` (default).

Either setting results in ``\Models\CarTyre`` being converted to ``car_tyre``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
        public static $_table_use_short_name = true;
    }

To override the default naming behaviour and directly specify a table name,
add a **public static** property to your class called ``$_table``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
        public static $_table = 'my_user_table';
    }

Auto prefixing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To save having type out model class name prefixes whenever code utilises ``Model::for_table()``
it is possible to specify a prefix that will be prepended onto the class name.

See the :doc:`Configuration` documentation for more details.

ID column
~~~~~~~~~

Paris requires that your database tables have a unique primary key
column. By default, Paris will use a column called ``id``. To override
this default behaviour, add a **public static** property to your class
called ``$_id_column``:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    class User extends Model {
        public static $_id_column = 'my_id_column';
    }

**Note** - Paris has its *own* default ID column name mechanism, and
does not respect column names specified in Idiormâ€™s configuration.
