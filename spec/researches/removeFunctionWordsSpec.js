		var paper = new Paper( "Think before you drink – about how to recycle your coffee cup Less than 1% of takeaway coffee cups get recycled – or “dramatically less than 1%” in the striking phrase of Peter Goodwin, co-founder of the UK’s only paper-coffee-cup recycling business. It takes a specialist company, because the plastic used to laminate the cups has to be removed before the paper is pulped. A bit like the fruit juice cartons that, as any eager recycler will know, are not to be confused with cardboard and are processed alongside paper cups in Stainland, West Yorkshire, at the UK’s only carton recycling plant. In fact the number of takeaway coffee cups recycled in the UK, either in Stainland or at a cup recycling plant in Cumbria, is 3m out of an annual total of an estimated 3bn – around 0.1%, or one in 1,000 cups (another few million are sent for recycling abroad). Some newspapers, citing unnamed “campaigners”, this week blamed the coffee chains, some of whom print the recycling symbol of three arrows on their cups. Consumers, they said, believe the symbol means the cups are destined for recycling and, since this isn’t the case for 99.9% of them, are being misled. The truth is that whether or not our paper cup has a chance of rebirth as a newspaper or an egg box depends on where we throw it away – and whether the council that collects it recycles paper cups or not. The bad news for lovers of hot drinks on the move is that the council almost certainly doesn’t and even if it did, the worst place to throw anything away is a bin on the street. Statistics on street bin recycling rates are hard to come by. But Helen Bingham of Keep Britain Tidy says Britain is bad at on-street recycling because it is “inconsistent and confusing”. Some councils offer separate bins for cans, glass and general litter while others don’t. Nobody wants to stop and study the signs when they are desperate to get shot of their lukewarm dregs. Contamination is rife, meaning that even if you do take the trouble to dispose of things properly, chances are they will end up in landfill anyway. Giant retailers such Costa and Starbucks have a responsibility, as Starbucks recognised when it launched a scheme giving customers a 25p discount for bringing their own cup. But reusable cups made of silicone and rubber have not really caught on, probably because they need washing up. Cups are not reusable in the same way as plastic bags, and if this means we are stuck with paper-plastic hybrids, retailers should contribute to the cost of getting rid of them in an environmentally responsible way, either through higher taxes or by helping local authorities design workable cup recycling schemes. Non-takeaway hot drinks should, of course, be served in ceramic cups. In our homes we have made progress, with 44.9% of our annual household waste of 27m tonnes recycled at the latest count, and an EU target of 50% by 2020. Here too the lack of consistency is an issue. Not perhaps if you have lived in the same village for 30 years, and know perfectly well that the brown wheelie bin for compostable waste must be left out on alternate Tuesdays. But if you are moving between addresses and across borough boundaries – more likely in London than anywhere else, because 32 local authorities plus the City of London are separated by just a few miles – you will understand why the capital has such a poor record, with rates as low as 17.7%. Councils should be incentivised to harmonise their arrangements. The new combined authorities of the northern powerhouse could lead the way. As for London, the mayor should take the lead – bang some rubbish bags together and join things up, partner successful councils with failing ones and launch a citywide scheme – for street recycling if nothing else. If the Germans can manage 62%, why not us? But the bigger point is the same as with greenhouse gases, and everything else that pertains to the environment. Our planet’s resources are finite. Just as we are filling up the air with carbon dioxide, so we are filling up giant holes in the ground with rubbish. This week we have learned that takeaway coffee cups are taking up too much space in these smelly pits. Next time you buy a coffee, think about it.");
