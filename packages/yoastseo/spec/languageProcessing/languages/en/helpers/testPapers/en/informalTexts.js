const informalText1 = "This book is a fucking axe to the heart. But because my heart, perhaps yours, too, " +
	"was broken long ago, no further damage can be done. So perhaps the book's more like a probe, yes, a " +
	"very discomfiting probe, making a fuller assessment of the wreckage. The book is also a final report of the survey. " +
	"Finally, one thinks, here’s someone who has not only plumbed the depths of heartbreak, but who’s taken excruciatingly " +
	"detailed notes along the way revealing every nuance of the required self-abasement. The result is an astonishing catharsis for the reader.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"This is what literature at its best can do. Think Aeschylus’s Oresteia, but with an all-mortal cast and without " +
	"the choruses. I speak here of the novel’s sheer emotional power.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"For most of the novel the narrative is the first-person thoughts, fantasies, worries, shames and fears of Elio in the summer " +
	"of his 17th year. The young man is with his parents at their big comfortable summer house on the Italian Riviera. " +
	"It’s the mid-1980s. The boy’s father is an academic and Oliver, 24, is a young American colleague exchanging some brief " +
	"work as amanuensis for room and board while finishing his own manuscript. But in the marvelous, big-hearted " +
	"Italian sense, Oliver, even if for only the six weeks of his stay, is very much a part of the family.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Women are alluring to Elio but they are not his predominant fascination this particular summer. Description is thin " +
	"at first, almost transient, and because the reader’s not distracted by descriptive flights he or she never feels " +
	"far from the anguish of Elio. Life’s first love is the theme, and this iteration is so fresh, so vivid and " +
	"beautifully layered, that it’s not to be missed. Among the best parts of the novel are those passages in which " +
	"Elio—before his intimacy with Oliver begins—imagines what he might say to Oliver, the multiple responses he might " +
	"at any moment utter in Oliver’s presence, or imagined presence. Elio’s mind is racing with alternative scenarios. " +
	"Is this even what he wants? He’s not sure but he wants to find out. Matters are thought out and after some new bit " +
	"of action or information, rethought and modified. The technique reminds me of Philip Roth’s American Pastoral, " +
	"in which circumstances are similarly considered then reconsidered. There is a mastery of tone here that constantly astonishes and bewilders.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Later in the novel, when the description intensifies, it’s as if it has been saved for just these moments of lovemaking, " +
	"the confidential exchanges between the two in their subsequent walks and swims, their farewell in Rome, the devastating coda. " +
	"It is the frankness between the two young men that to my mind constitutes the book’s magic. That something as amorphous " +
	"as desire can be written about with such fluidity and integrity is near miraculous. The wrenching depiction of Elio’s " +
	"new and utterly discomfiting passion consumes not only him but us as well.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"In closing, let me say that this book is likely to resound more with those with some mileage on them (real or metaphorical). " +
	"The prerequisite is suffering. One can’t imagine the novel’s insights and wisdom working their wonders on anyone who " +
	"hasn’t at some time put everything on the line. The end was simply excruciating yet I couldn't stop reading. " +
	"Extremely powerful. I will reread this one soon. In terms of achievement, I place Call Me By Your Name on " +
	"the same shelf as Madame Bovary and Lolita and, yes, very near Aeschylus too.";

const informalText2 = "Because Amsterdam is in the Netherlands.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"I’m Dutch and proud of it. When I travel abroad I rarely return thinking: ‘I wish our country had this thing they have there, " +
	"because it would make our country better’. I genuinely believe I live in one of the best places you could live. " +
	"We could have adopted the American system of installing traffic lights across the intersections, " +
	"so you don’t have to hurt your neck looking up at the red light if you’re in the front of the cueue, but that’s about it I think.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Except for public toilets. We barely have any here, and when we do you have to pay for them.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"It’s the one thing that always struck me when we used to go on holiday by car. You drive a thousand kilometers, " +
	"cross several countries, make regular stops and everywhere you park your car in any country, there will be restroom facility " +
	"that is usually clean-ish and free. When you drive back home, having gotten used to this obvious public service it immediately " +
	"strikes you as soon as you cross the Dutch border: stops don’t even necessarily have toilets. Not all trains have toilets. " +
	"Shopping malls may not have toilets and the ones that do cost money.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"It’s getting better, but we still put new trains into service that don’t have toilets, we still build train and subway stations, " +
	"or shopping malls without toilets. It’s a weird blind spot of the Dutch and the difference is striking; " +
	"all surrounding countries; England, Germany, Belgium - they all have public toilet facilities wherever you’d expect them, " +
	"but we don’t; at least not necessarily.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"We’re bad at public toilets. I have no explanation for it.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"EDIT:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Although I still stand by my answer in the sense that I think that I genuinely believe that the Netherlands isn’t as " +
	"generous with public toilets as several other countries are in my personal experience, it is now clear from the comments " +
	"that it led some people to assume that The Netherlands is a country that you should avoid if you have some kind of medical" +
	" problem that requires you to have good access to public facilities.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Although we can surely stand to lose some tourists in Amsterdam so in a way this outcome would be a win, " +
	"I think we need some perspective here. What I’m talking about is that the situation here could easily be a lot better " +
	"and there are in fact places that have the toilet situation better organised than we do. But if you scan the comments " +
	"you can find plenty of responses from Germans and Italians that claim that it’s just the same where they live. " +
	"There is a certain ‘in the eye of the beholder’ thing at play here as well.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Of course you would be able to go to the toilet here. My point was really that considering how well our " +
	"country is organised on average, it’s strange that the restroom situation isn’t also ‘among the best in the world’. " +
	"That was my real point. I wasn’t going to mention it, but the recent comments seem to all be from elderly people " +
	"changing travel plans to avoid Amsterdam in order to not get in trouble due to their tricky bladder. By all means, " +
	"give Amsterdam a miss; we’re looking for ways to reduce overtourism here, but we were thinking more about " +
	"the no-money backpackers and weekend drinkers, and not the more affluent ones with bladder issues.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"We do have public toilets. You can, usually, use toilets in bars and restaurants. We’re not some weird ‘anti-toilet’ country. " +
	"We’re merely ‘not quite as good’ as I think we should be.";
