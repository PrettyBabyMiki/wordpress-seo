	"Serbian troops invade and kill nearly all the men. It becomes the worst massacre in post-war European history. " +

	"Peace missions\n" +
	"Right from the outset, the Dutch army has participated in United Nations peace operations. Dutch soldiers thus rank among " +
	"more than a million deployed servicemen from some 120 countries. On behalf of the UN, the troops supervise compliance " +
	"with peace agreements in several regions. The first mission is launched in 1948, in Israel. A recurrent problem in these " +
	"operations is the so-called mandate: as peacekeepers, UN soldiers are only allowed to use force in self-defence. " +
	"They are given little military leeway to defend and protect civilians.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"In 1991, the collapse of the Republic of Yugoslavia is followed by the outbreak of civil war between several federal states. " +
	"In some states, independence is pursued with great force. In one such state, Bosnia- Herzegovina, the battle between " +
	"the different groups of the population is particularly fierce. In 1993, the UN Security Council, in its Resolution 819, " +
	"designates the town of Srebrenica as a “safe area”, a so-called enclave. The town is under UN protection, " +
	"and may no longer be fired upon or besieged by Serbian Bosnians. This enclave harbours a large number of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims). " +
	"The UN sets up a peace force to enforce Resolution 819 in Srebrenica. In 1994, a battalion of Dutch troops, Dutchbat III, " +
	"is sent to Srebrenica to undertake this task.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Genocide\n" +
	"Dutchbat is but lightly armed and has few means to keep the peace around Srebrenica. In the spring of 1995, " +
	"Serbian Bosnians start blockading the supply convoys provisioning Dutchbat, which weakens their position even further. " +
	"In addition, the Serbs attempt to intimidate Dutchbat in all sorts of ways. On 6 July 1995, the Bosnian-Serbian general " +
	"Ratko Mladić sends his troops towards Srebrenica. Without much resistance, the assailants invade the Bosniak safe " +
	"haven six days later. Many Bosniak men and boys make a fruitless attempt at escaping.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"With assistance from the Dutch soldiers, the Serbs first separate the men and boys who are left behind from the women " +
	"and children, whereupon they are removed in buses. They are joined with another group of captured refugees, " +
	"and shortly thereafter, nearly all these Bosniaks are executed by the Serbs. It is the largest massacre in Europe " +
	"since the end of World War II. A total of 8,372 names are engraved in the commemorative monument in nearby Potočari.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Responsibility\n" +
	"Once news of the disaster reaches the Netherlands, the question arises as to whether the Dutch soldiers could have " +
	"done more to protect the enclave from the Serbs. Many Dutch people wonder whether their country has failed on a moral level. " +
	"The Dutch Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies (NIOD) launches a thorough investigation, " +
	"which goes on for six years. Among other things, the investigation points out the vagueness and the infeasibility " +
	"of the UN assignment. In fact, the Dutchbat assignment was a mission impossible. When the NIOD report is published in 2002, " +
	"Prime Minister Wim Kok assumes political responsibility for the disaster in Srebrenica and resigns. " +
	"Among the Dutch government, the event raises awareness of the complexity of peace missions. From that day on, " +
	"it ensures that soldiers are sufficiently well armed when being sent on such missions; cases in point are " +
	"the Dutch missions to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"In 2017 and 2019, respectively, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicts the leaders " +
	"of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzić and Ratko Mladić, for their part in the murders. Surviving relatives continue " +
	"to institute legal proceedings, in the pursuit of answers to questions regarding responsibility and culpability. " +
	"Srebrenica remains an open wound.\"";

const formalText2 = "\"　By the turn of the century, the middle-class home in North American had been transformed. " +
	"The flow of industry has passed and left idle the loom in the attic, the soap kettle in the shed, Ellen Richards wrote in 1908. " +
	"The urban middle class was now able to buy a wide array of food products and clothing — baked goods, canned goods, " +
	"suits, shirts, shoes, and dresses. Not only had household production waned, but technological improvements were " +
	"rapidly changing the rest of domestic work. Middle-class homes had indoor running water and furnaces, run on oil, coal, " +
	"or gas, that produced hot water. Stoves were fueled by gas, and delivery services provided ice for refrigerators. " +
	"Electric power was available for lamps, sewing machines, irons, and even vacuum cleaners. No domestic task was unaffected. " +
	"Commercial laundries, for instance, had been doing the wash for urban families for decades; by the early 1900's " +
	"the first electric washing machines were on the market.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"　　One impact of the new household technology was to draw sharp dividing lines between women of different classes and regions. " +
	"Technological advances always affected the homes of the wealthy first, filtering downward into the urban middle class. " +
	"But women who lived on farms were not yet affected by household improvements. Throughout the nineteenth century " +
	"and well into the twentieth, rural homes lacked running water and electric power. Farm women had to haul large quantities " +
	"of water into the house from wells or pumps for every purpose. Doing the family laundry, in large vats heated over stoves, " +
	"continued to be a full day's work, just as canning and preserving continued to be seasonal necessities. Heat was provided " +
	"by wood or coal stoves. In addition, rural women continued to produce most of their families' clothing. The urban poor, " +
	"similarly, reaped few benefits from household improvements. Urban slums such as Chicago's nineteenth ward often had no sewers, " +
	"garbage collection, or gas or electric lines; and tenements lacked both running water and central heating. " +
	"At the turn of the century, variations in the nature of women's domestic work were probably more marked than at any time before.\"";
