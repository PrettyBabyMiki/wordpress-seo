const semiFormalText1 = "\"Therapy is not magic nor is it a process where a therapist is able to “fix” you.  " +
	"I  sometimes joke with clients that if I had a magic wand under my chair (or on my desk in times of tele-therapy), " +
	"I could wave it and all would be better.  This certainly would make therapy go faster, wouldn’t it?  Alas, " +
	"this is not the case. But it’s true that many come to therapy with some preconceived notions of what the process " +
	"entails and one of the most common fantasies is that their therapist will give them advice.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"“Just tell me what to do!”\n" +
	"\n" +
	"It’s not to say that there are not therapists out there regularly dispensing advice as I believe there are. " +
	" But for those who see themselves as a guide for growth and personal empowerment for their clients,  they will refrain.  " +
	"There are plenty of good reasons why your therapist will likely not give you advice.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Your therapist is not you.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"As much as your therapist delves into the intricacies, characters and emotional waves of your life, they are not in that life. " +
	" You share a sacred space together to do your work but he or she is not walking in the footsteps of your day to day.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Your therapist is not wiser than you.  \n" +
	"\n" +
	"Another common misconception is that therapists have perfect mistake-free lives and surely must be more wise.  This is not true. " +
	" Therapists are humans too and can have similar challenges.  Keep in mind it also can be much easier to guide " +
	"another person than see through your own forest.  Yes, therapists train to hold their professions and likely know more " +
	"than you about relationship dynamics, depression, anxiety, trauma and the impact of family of origin issues but " +
	"they are not inherently wiser.  You are also wise but may simply need help tapping into your own inner wisdom.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Your therapist probably seeks to empower you.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Whatever obstacles have been standing in the way of you creating the positive change you seek, you are in therapy " +
	"to identify and understand your blocks then move towards their resolution.  The most powerful work happens when you meet " +
	"all of those markers, your sense of self strengthening along the way.  This road to personal empowerment can’t happen " +
	"if the therapist gives you all of “the answers” or tells you what to do.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Advice giving is not therapy.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The work of psychotherapy involves training around the complexities of human behavior, need for emotional safety, " +
	"brain science and many therapeutic modalities that therapists use in their toolbox.  Some are loyal to one paradigm " +
	"and others more eclectic.  The bottom line is that it’s a journey taken together between therapist and client where " +
	"trust is established in order for the deeper work to begin.  It is not meant to be a bandaid only but ideally triggering lifelong changes.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"If you’re in therapy or considering it and hoping to get advice, that’s ok.  You’re not the only one.  " +
	"When I’m asked for advice, I always remind them of the importance of coming to their own conclusions. " +
	"But of course I will hope to help guide them to that place.   Therapists have a unique vantage point " +
	"in their close knowledge of their clients without the emotional entanglements of literally being in their lives. " +
	" They are trained to see seek to understand your whole picture with curiosity, gently leading you to your own conclusions.\n" +

const semiFormalText2 = "\"Puppies are beyond adorable, but let's face it — raising a puppy is fraught with challenges. " +
	"If you've never had a puppy before, the task before you can seem quite daunting, and once those big puppy eyes capture your heart, " +
	"there's no turning back. Here are some helpful tips to get through the puppy development stage and ensure your new " +
	"four-legged baby grows up into a happy, healthy, well-adjusted dog.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Puppies are little bundles of energy who are often intensely curious about their surroundings. Life with a puppy is " +
	"not that different from life with a human toddler—you'll need a lot of patience as you watch over your pup to keep him out of trouble," +
	" instruct him in appropriate behavior and safely teach him about the world.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"The good news is that puppies sleep a lot, although they don't always sleep through the night, and your pup may wake " +
	"the household whining and barking to express his displeasure at being left alone. Puppies are also driven to chew a " +
	"lot as their adult teeth come in, and may see the doggie version of a teething ring in the living room rug, the couch, " +
	"your favorite pair of shoes and even your hand. If you become frustrated with your new pet, it's important to remember " +
	"that the task of raising a puppy is temporary. He'll be all grown up by his first birthday, and he'll leave most of his " +
	"puppy tendencies behind as he settles into adulthood.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"If you just got a puppy or are getting ready to go pick up your little bundle of joy, you need to be prepared for " +
	"the new responsibility that is another life. This means taking time out of your busy schedule to tend to his needs. " +
	"So, if you are planning on getting a puppy, it is a good idea to do so when you can take time off work, or work from home, " +
	"to spend with him. This will allow you to let him out to do his business frequently, as well as monitor behaviors " +
	"that he might try to engage in when you're away from the home.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Puppy-proofing Your Home\n" +
	"It's impossible to provide constant supervision for your energetic, curious pup, so it's important to prepare your " +
	"home before letting him loose in it. Secure electrical cords and move potentially toxic plants or substances, " +
	"such as cleaning supplies and insecticides, out of reach. It's a good idea to crawl through your home to get a " +
	"puppy's-eye view of his surroundings. Remove anything he might be tempted to chew or swallow, and close off vents, " +
	"pet doors or any other openings that might allow him to become lost or stuck. Not only will this help keep him safe, " +
	"it will also ease your anxiety that your new pup is lost.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"You'll need to be ready to start house training your pup as soon as you bring him home. If you plan to crate train him, " +
	"have the crate ready. Make it comfortable by lining it with blankets or a dog bed, but make sure it's large enough " +
	"that he'll have plenty of room to stand up, turn around, and lie down. Slowly introduce him to the crate by leaving" +
	" the door open and letting him explore it on his own. You can help tempt him to go in by throwing in a toy or a " +
	"couple of pieces of food. The more comfortable he is with going into the crate, the easier it will be on both of you during training.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"If you're forgoing a crate, prepare a small area, such as a powder room or a corner of a kitchen or laundry room," +
	" where he can be confined and kept away from other pets and small children. Be sure to provide some puppy " +
	"training pads to catch any accidents, and include a dog bed, his food and water dishes and a toy or two. " +
	"This area will serve as home base, a safe space from which he can slowly be introduced to the other members of" +
	" your household and that provides a retreat when he becomes overwhelmed or needs a time out.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Supplies You'll Need\n" +
	"You'll need to stock up on a number of supplies to keep your puppy happy and healthy.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Puppy Nutrition\n" +
	"Puppies have different nutrient and energy requirements than adult dogs. Look for a high quality puppy food that " +
	"is specially formulated to support puppy development and growth. The proper quantity of food depends on factors " +
	"like age, size, and breed. It's a good idea to consult your vet about how much and how often to feed your pup.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"For some small breeds, it can be best to free feed young pups to ensure they receive adequate nutrition. " +
	"Toy and small breed dogs reach physical maturity faster than larger breeds, and can be switched over to adult dog " +
	"food and adult-sized portions between nine and twelve months of age.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Larger breeds can take a full two years to reach physical maturity, and should stick with a puppy formula during that time. " +
	"They should also be fed multiple meals each day with controlled portions to prevent complications, such as stomach " +
	"bloat and buildup of excess protein or calcium, which could lead to conditions like hip dysplasia. " +
	"A structured feeding schedule for your larger breed pup could look something like this:\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Six to twelve weeks old: Four meals per day\n" +
	"Three to six months old: Three meals per day\n" +
	"Six months and up: Two meals per day\n" +
	"Training and Socialization\n" +
	"Brown Australian Shepherd puppy peeing on the grass with other puppies in the background\n" +
	"You'll want to begin house training right away. Dogs instinctively try to avoid soiling their bed and the area around it, " +
	"so keeping him confined to a small area or crate as he gets used to going outside will be key, says Dog Star Daily. " +
	"Establish a potty routine, keeping in mind that young puppies will typically need to go out once every couple of hours. " +
	"Until he's had all his vaccinations, take him to a section of the yard where he won't be exposed to other animals." +
	" When he successfully relieves himself outdoors, be sure to lavish him with praise and reward him with a treat.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"When it comes to both house training and establishing the rules of appropriate conduct, it's important to be patient " +
	"with your pup and use positive reinforcement to build happy associations with correct behavior. It's generally best " +
	"to ignore unwanted behavior, or correct your pup with a simple but firm \"\"no.\"\" Never hit or yell at your " +
	"pup—this will only confuse him and cause him to feel anxious and fearful. When he engages in negative behavior " +
	"try and direct him back to something positive. For instance, if he is chewing on something he shouldn't be, " +
	"direct him back to one of his toys. As soon as he's old enough, consider enrolling him in an obedience class. " +
	"This will not only teach him how to behave, but will also help promote socialization and provide you with the " +
	"skills to properly train him.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Proper socialization is a key element of successfully raising a puppy. In order for him to grow up into a well-adjusted dog, " +
	"he needs to be exposed to as many new people, places, experiences and situations as possible. " +
	"While you should wait until he's had all his vaccinations before taking him out in public or " +
	"letting him get close to other animals, you can start socializing your pup right away by simply playing with him " +
	"and introducing him to new people, sights, sounds, smells, and textures.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Your Puppy's Health\n" +
	"One of the first steps to take after getting your new puppy is to schedule a wellness visit with a veterinarian. " +
	"If you don't already have an established vet, ask around. Your family, friends and coworkers will likely be able " +
	"to provide you with plenty of recommendations.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"At his first appointment, your vet will check your puppy for any health problems or parasites, and will likely " +
	"recommend a program for controlling parasites, such as fleas, ticks and heartworms. She'll also establish a " +
	"vaccination schedule and advise you on when you should bring him in to be neutered, which can help reduce the risk " +
	"of health and behavioral problems as he gets older.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Your vet can also answer any questions or concerns you have about caring for your pup, such as what type of food to " +
	"feed him and how much he should be given. Either your vet or the veterinary assistant can also advise you on aspects " +
	"of puppy care such as tooth brushing and nail trimming, and can even show you how it's properly done.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"While you're at the vet you can try and schedule his 6-month vet visit. This vet will use this visit to check on the " +
	"growth and progress of your pup to make sure everything looks good from a health perspective. They can even start to give you " +
	"tips on preparing you as you go through the adolescent period, which can be a challenging time for pet parents as pups grow" +
	" into sexual maturity. This also is a good chance to talk about what to expect as your pup grows into adulthood.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Puppy Play\n" +
	"Outside of training and general health, puppies need attention and exercise. The good news is that this doesn't always mean" +
	"walks around the block, jogging throughout the neighborhood, or trips to the dog park. Playing with your puppy is " +
	"often enough exercise to keep him healthy while building a bond between the both of you. Games like fetch, tug-of-war " +
	"and hide-and-seek are all games that can be played within the home to help release pent up energy he might have gotten" +
	" from being home alone all day. Make sure to take 15-30 minutes every day to play with him in addition to walking him" +
	" or letting him in your backyard to run around.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Grooming\n" +
	"Even dogs that don't require a trim every few weeks need some sort of grooming. Starting the grooming process while " +
	"your pup is still young will make it much easier on you. Grooming includes trimmings, brushing his coat, his teeth, " +
	"trimming his nails and bathing him. You can absolutely hire a professional groomer for haircuts or the vet for nail" +
	" trimming, but you'll want to get your dog used to having to sit still while you primp and preen him. " +
	"Get him used to the feeling of a brush in his fur, this is especially true of dogs that shed a lot or are prone to matting." +
	" Bathing your puppy can be a chore in itself, so come in prepared with plenty of towels (and clothes you're not afraid to get wet in) " +
	"and slowly introduce him to the shampoo and water. As he starts to get more comfortable, this process will become easier. " +
	"Finally, brushing his teeth may seem strange to a lot of pet owners, but it can go a long way to protecting your dog's mouth. " +
	"Here are some tips to getting your puppy used to you brushing his teeth.\n" +
	"\n" +
	"Raising a puppy is not an easy task, but it's an adventure that's full of rewards as you develop a deep bond with your " +
	"pup that will last throughout his life. A lot of patience and a little extra effort will turn your rambunctious pupper " +
	"into a fun-loving gentleman that will make all the effort that goes into his development worthwhile.\"";
