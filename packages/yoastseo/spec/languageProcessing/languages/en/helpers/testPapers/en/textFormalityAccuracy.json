    "Introducing work\nThere are many ways to introduce an academic essay or short paper. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions:\n\nestablish the context, background and/or importance of the topic\npresent an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study\ndefine the topic and/or key terms used in the paper\nstate the purpose of the essay or short paper\nprovide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing\nSlightly less complex introductions may simply inform the reader: what the topic is, why it is important, and how the writing is organised. In very short assignments, it is not uncommon for a writer to commence simply by stating the purpose of their writing.\n\nIntroductions to research dissertations and theses tend to be relatively short compared to the other sections of the text but quite complex in terms of their functional elements. Some of the more common elements include:\n\nestablishing the context, background and/or importance of the topic\ngiving a brief review of the relevant academic literature\nidentifying a problem, controversy or a knowledge gap in the field of study\nstating the aim(s) of the research and the research questions or hypotheses\nproviding a synopsis of the research design and method(s)\nexplaining the significance or value of the study\ndefining certain key terms\nproviding an overview of the dissertation or report structure\nExamples of phrases which are commonly employed to realise these functions can be seen by clicking on the headings listed below. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the categories under which the phrases are listed. Also, the order in which the different categories of phrases are shown reflects a typical order but this is far from fixed or rigid, and not all the elements are present in all introductions.\n\nA number of analysts have identified common patterns in the introductions of research articles. One of the best known patterns is the CARS model (create a research space) first described by John Swales (1990). This model, which utilises an ecological metaphor, has, in its simplest form, three elements or moves:\n\nEstablishing the territory (establishing importance of the topic, reviewing previous work)\nIdentifying a niche (indicating a gap in knowledge)\nOccupying the niche (listing purpose of new research, listing questions, stating the value of the work, indicating the structure of the writing)",
    "Whilst Dutch servicemen are tasked with protecting the Bosnian enclave of Srebrenica, Serbian troops invade and kill nearly all the men. It becomes the worst massacre in post-war European history. The Dutch connection with this event brings the Netherlands great embarrassment and changes its approach to participation in peace missions abroad.\n\nPeriod\nTijd van televisie en computer\nHeadlines\nWie bestuurt er?\nWat geeft betekenis?\nPeace missions\nRight from the outset, the Dutch army has participated in United Nations peace operations. Dutch soldiers thus rank among more than a million deployed servicemen from some 120 countries. On behalf of the UN, the troops supervise compliance with peace agreements in several regions. The first mission is launched in 1948, in Israel. A recurrent problem in these operations is the so-called mandate: as peacekeepers, UN soldiers are only allowed to use force in self-defence. They are given little military leeway to defend and protect civilians.\n\nIn 1991, the collapse of the Republic of Yugoslavia is followed by the outbreak of civil war between several federal states. In some states, independence is pursued with great force. In one such state, Bosnia- Herzegovina, the battle between the different groups of the population is particularly fierce. In 1993, the UN Security Council, in its Resolution 819, designates the town of Srebrenica as a \u201csafe area\u201d, a so-called enclave. The town is under UN protection, and may no longer be fired upon or besieged by Serbian Bosnians. This enclave harbours a large number of Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims). The UN sets up a peace force to enforce Resolution 819 in Srebrenica. In 1994, a battalion of Dutch troops, Dutchbat III, is sent to Srebrenica to undertake this task.\n\nGenocide\nDutchbat is but lightly armed and has few means to keep the peace around Srebrenica. In the spring of 1995, Serbian Bosnians start blockading the supply convoys provisioning Dutchbat, which weakens their position even further. In addition, the Serbs attempt to intimidate Dutchbat in all sorts of ways. On 6 July 1995, the Bosnian-Serbian general Ratko Mladi\u0107 sends his troops towards Srebrenica. Without much resistance, the assailants invade the Bosniak safe haven six days later. Many Bosniak men and boys make a fruitless attempt at escaping.\n\nWith assistance from the Dutch soldiers, the Serbs first separate the men and boys who are left behind from the women and children, whereupon they are removed in buses. They are joined with another group of captured refugees, and shortly thereafter, nearly all these Bosniaks are executed by the Serbs. It is the largest massacre in Europe since the end of World War II. A total of 8,372 names are engraved in the commemorative monument in nearby Poto\u010dari.\n\nResponsibility\nOnce news of the disaster reaches the Netherlands, the question arises as to whether the Dutch soldiers could have done more to protect the enclave from the Serbs. Many Dutch people wonder whether their country has failed on a moral level. The Dutch Institute for War, Holocaust, and Genocide Studies (NIOD) launches a thorough investigation, which goes on for six years. Among other things, the investigation points out the vagueness and the infeasibility of the UN assignment. In fact, the Dutchbat assignment was a mission impossible. When the NIOD report is published in 2002, Prime Minister Wim Kok assumes political responsibility for the disaster in Srebrenica and resigns. Among the Dutch government, the event raises awareness of the complexity of peace missions. From that day on, it ensures that soldiers are sufficiently well armed when being sent on such missions; cases in point are the Dutch missions to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2017 and 2019, respectively, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicts the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzi\u0107 and Ratko Mladi\u0107, for their part in the murders. Surviving relatives continue to institute legal proceedings, in the pursuit of answers to questions regarding responsibility and culpability. Srebrenica remains an open wound.",
    "\nAre Humans Ready For Machine-Generated Art? \n \n\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence, the technical term for a machine that can learn, be creative, solve complex problems and answer complex questions, has reached an advanced degree of maturity. There appears to be a broad consensus on the use of automation and artificial intelligence as new and powerful platforms enabling a better, more efficient, smarter and more connected future than ever before.\nArtificial Intelligence has reached a new and profound stage of exploration. The advances of AI in computer vision and pattern recognition have already taken some very important steps toward the creation of art. In general, we are seeing advances in AI that make it more like a human, capable of being able to learn. And, in that sense, artificial intelligence is also very much like a human artist. Many artificial intelligence researchers have raised concerns on whether artificial intelligence can actually be creative, and whether they could even develop a good style for themselves. This can be dangerous to artists, though it needs to be carefully observed.\nAs AI technologies progress, it would seem there is always a danger of these developments becoming too much, creating the potential for unintended consequences. Artists in particular have come to be concerned about how we might take this potential step toward AI and what the implications would be in terms of its potential effects on society.\nThis is the first sentence of this introduction that is being written by a human, everything preceding it (including the spelling and phrasing errors) are quotes from outputs generated using OpenAI\u2019s GPT-2 language model[1]. A publicly available program that generates completely new text based on prompts from the user, prompts as simple as \u201ctalk about the recent rise of AI, and analyze the question of whether it can create art.\u201d We specifically set up a GPT-2 model and our own prompts to demonstrate that, even in the present day, the following clarification is needed: the rest of this paper will be written by humans!\nArtificial intelligence is advancing rapidly, even in unexpected fields. OpenAI has other models that also create music, images, and more[2]. They even deemed some projects too dangerous to release publicly. While discussions about the dangers surrounding this technology are needed, we will tackle this topic from a more philosophical perspective in this paper. We will expand on the concerns that our model outputs expressed:  How do art,  society,  and technology interact? Can machines be artists? And while most literature stops at those two questions, we also aim to explore whether societies will accept artificial artists as part of our cultures. Will we reject this possibility, or happily coexist with such entities?\n \n\n\nWhat Is Art?\nArt is deeply intertwined with most parts of our cultures. We create and experience it to express ourselves and our values, to carry out our rituals, to relate and identify with each other, and even for profit.  And although it is such a vital part of society, it is not a straightforward concept to define. But, as most things, we can look at multiple definitions to get a better understanding.\nArt can be defined as a process. This process of creation can be viewed in two different ways. The first being that art is a language of expressing oneself, your emotions and ideas[3]. Thus, art has to originate from real experiences and thoughts. The second view is that art is mostly about imitation. Taking inspiration from our environments, or other artists, and combining or transforming those ideas to create something new[4].\nIt can also be defined as the outcome, and there is a distinction between two perspectives here as well. The objective view is that there are concrete criteria for deciding what is art and what is not, while the subjective view is that it is up to the individual to decide what art is. Thus, from the subjective view, there are no limits to what can be considered art. Those distinctions are not necessarily exclusive of each other; while the perception of art is highly individual, this perception is largely affected by cultural, societal, and historical contexts[3].\nTechnology has always played a role in creating, conveying, or even being art.  This is especially easy to observe in recent times, where art can be produced, performed, and distributed completely electronically. In many ways, technology has been an incredible tool for artists, but some have viewed a few of its developments as an intrusion of art\u2019s purity, a distortion of artistic values and norms that artists identify as their own culture. Now, the role of technology may surpass mere instrumentalism, and the question becomes whether technology itself can be the artist.\nObviously, most of the aforementioned definitions are human-centric, and give the impression that art is intrinsically human. Many arguments are made that machines can only analyze data, recog- nize patterns, and reconstruct them. And therefore AI is only able to re-iterate human creations. But this still fits well with the mimesis view. Humans in general are imitative creatures[5], and therefore, how are pattern-reproducing machines any different?\n\nArt-ificial Intelligence\nMachines\u2019 ability to be artists is difficult to reason about, as our loose definitions of something like an \u201cartist\u201d may include the fact that they have to be human. The more interesting question is whether machines can create art that fits the definitions we discussed earlier, both when looking at the process, and the outcome.\nWhen defining art as the process, as mentioned before, one view is strictly about imitation. It is easy to argue that AI is fully capable of imitating its environment, nature, and other art. Therefore by this view, machines could very well be able to create art. As for the expressivist view, there is much more room for discussion and disagreement. While many would argue that machines do not have a \u201cself\u201d that they can express[3], it should also be argued that we do not have any scientific definition of what \u201cself\u201d or consciousness is. As far as biology is concerned, humans are simply a motorized neural network. So the idea that only humans can truly be creative can be viewed as self-centered or even close minded.\nWhen reasoning about art as the outcome, machines can adhere to objective criteria arguably more perfectly than humans, because they can simply program themselves to do so.  Obviously, the subjective view is completely individual, and there is no doubt that there exists an abundance of people who can enjoy and appreciate AI-generated art.\n \n\n\n\nIn fact, there have been a few studies and experiments showing that humans are already incapable of differentiating art that was created by a human from art that was created by machines; in one of the surveys, up to eighty-five percent of participants were not able to make that distinction when it comes to paintings[6]. And when it comes to other forms of art, OpenAI, one of the leading artificial intelligence research laboratories, makes most of their projects, or demonstrations of those projects, available to the public. And one can easily experience musical compositions[7], writing[1], images[8], or complete songs[9] fully generated by AI. So society is already starting to expose itself to the world of machine-created art.\nBeing one of the most popular organizations in this field, OpenAI is put in the spotlight quite often,  by academic and non-academic writings that reflect some of the sentiments that society may express.  The quality of those creations tends to be praised,  but potential malicious uses of the technology are also highlighted, as well as concerns regarding societal biases that these models may have due to a lack of diversity in their training data[10]. This gets us to the most interesting part of this discussion, will this artificial art integrate into our societies and cultures,  or will it simply remain an academic experiment?\n\nSocietal Impacts And Reactions\nIn almost every culture, rapid extreme changes tend to be rejected, societies often steer clear of great uncertainties. It is a reasonable reaction to fear the future where we consume art that is created by machines, entities that we rarely relate to, empathize with, or view as \u201cbeings\u201d.  The fact that thousands of potential \u201cworks of art\u201d can be created in mere seconds by these machines may completely devalue art, especially when it reaches a level of quality that matches or surpasses human creation.\nAs mentioned before, art as a discipline has its own version of culture, with its own values and norms. While this type of culture tends to be more accepting of change than geographically- defined ones, ideas such as art being an expression of human emotion are almost a core value to a lot of artists.  So it is very unclear whether human artists will coexist, collaborate, or compete with artificial ones.\nAnother potential issue is the copyright disasters that this may entail. Most experts, as well as regular users of the internet, already view our copyright laws as flawed and outdated in the con- text of new technologies. The practical and obvious concern is how we can deal with art that is \u201ctoo\u201d imitative, especially if machines are not taught the concept of copyright. But even more interestingly, who actually owns AI generated art? OpenAI claims no ownership of any content created with GPT-2, and asserts that anyone may freely use it[11]. Thankfully, this puts us in the clear from plagiarism for our introduction, but it still raises the question, does the model itself deserve no credit?\nClearly, it is very easy to paint this future with a negative light, but ultimately, art exists because we enjoy it. Most people do not care about the race, gender, or religion of an artist when they experience their art. It is mostly a matter of whether it stimulates their senses. Thus, a logical continuation of that would be disregarding the nature of the artist as well, i.e. whether they are a human or a machine, as long as their art resonates with us.\nMany positive impacts can also be thought of for this potential future, like the idea of democra- tizing art[12]. Having an abundance of affordable \u201cone of a kind\u201d artworks of exquisite quality means that we can get to experience the beauty and whimsicality of these works for ourselves, without them being locked away in museums.\nThe coexistence, collaboration, and even competition between human and artificial artists can also all be viewed as potential positives, as competition can be beneficial in driving us to improve and innovate. Cooperating with machines is already happening[13] and will most likely continue to\n \n\n\n\nevolve in an even more mutually beneficial manner. Coexisting and collaborating with artificial intelligence to make art can also elevate our abilities, and even allow us to discover new styles, techniques, and perspectives on art, as well as perspectives on the \u201cminds\u201d of our collaborators.\nConsciousness has always been a matter of debate, both scientifically and philosophically. Most of us cannot fathom the idea that some pieces of silicon can (eventually) have such ability. But that idea has an immense number of implications on how we will interact with technology in the future, and the topic of art is absolutely one of those implications. As art is one of the defining aspects of our cultures, and what makes us human, this topic serves as a catalyst for discussion and thought about how we will eventually view these technologies.  Will machines\u2019 works of art define their own cultures? Express their own values, independent of humanity? Or will they integrate with our own cultures, sharing our values, and facing the same challenges alongside us?\nThis issue is of the kind that seems inevitable despite our complete lack of anticipation or under- standing of its effects. It is similar and obviously related to the question of sentience, and how we will deal with general purpose artificial intelligence. The best we can currently do is to speculate about how societies will react. So the question of whether we will accept machines as members of our cultures, or members of their own, is yet to be answered.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have explored multiple definitions of art, and discussed the ability of artificial intelligence to create artworks that fit those definitions. We also analyzed the interactions between art, society, and technology. Finally, we posed the question of how those interactions will evolve in the future, with the possibility of coexisting with creative machines that match or surpass our skills and intelligence.\nIn our view, machines can definitely be artists. Given the definitions of art, most writers use the expressivist perspective to argue against this viewpoint. But our opinion is that these arguments are built on narcissistic assumptions that only humans have the ability to express themselves and thus truly be creative, because scientific research still fails to find any concrete existence of a distinguishing \u2018self\u2019 or \u2018soul\u2019 in humans.\nWhile it is difficult to predict how or whether the art of machines will be integrated into society, we have a couple of clashing opinions. On the one hand, there is the view that, at least in the near future, we will simply continue to consider machine-generated art a technological exploration, and equating it to works from respected human artists will be rejected. On the other hand, we mostly think that AI can very well become an extension of humanity in many ways, and art is absolutely one of them. We also believe that any kind of art can be enjoyed regardless of the identity of its creators.\nTo close things off, we requested an opinion from our GPT-2 friend about whether it thinks machines can create art. \u201cThe question has intrigued me for a long time \u2013 I mean, in my humble opinion, yes.\u201d",
    "Tom Scheenen appointed professor of Biomedical Magnetic Resonance. Tom Scheenen has been appointed Professor of Biomedical Magnetic Resonance at the Radboudumc / Radboud University as of October 1st 2021. He aims to bridge the gap between the development of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques and the implementation of new applications in the clinic, improving visualization of cancer. Next to investigating the origin and spread of cancer, he also characterizes the tumor at hand.\n\nTom ScheenenMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) are versatile techniques that enable non-invasive three-dimensional imaging of patients. These techniques work with a strong magnetic field, which measures the presence and microscopic environment of protons in water, fat and metabolites, providing images with different contrasts of multiple tissues. In this way, cancer can be detected and staged locally, aggressiveness and metastatic spread can be assessed as well as the tumor\u2019s response to treatment.\n\nAs a biophysicist, Tom Scheenen focuses on the technical development of MRI and MRS: \"Working in the Department of Medical Imaging I am in direct contact with various medical specialists who can indicate clinical needs. What morphology and which processes in the body are important to a doctor to be visualized? I can choose the best technique and develop it into a clinical application. I\u2019ld also like to contribute to more fundamental research: how does a tumor develop in interaction with its surrounding tissue? With MRI, you can do all kinds of measurements on the structure and metabolism of a tumor.\"\n\nIronoxide nanoparticles\nScheenen works primarily on prostate cancer. In addition to the clinical MRI scanners at the Radboudumc, he also uses an experimental system located at the Erwin L Hahn Institute in Essen. \"The new scanner in Essen has a stronger magnetic field than the clinical scanners at the Radboudumc, as much as 7 Tesla. This improves sensitivity and  provides a higher spatial resolution of the images,\" Scheenen explains. In prostate cancer, he uses ultra-small particles of iron oxide (USPIOs) as a contrast agent to look for suspicious lymph nodes that may contain tumor cells. He now also uses this technique for cancer in other parts of the body like the pancreas, esophagus, rectum and head and neck.\n\nMajor milestones have been reached in the field of prostate cancer. Thanks in part to Scheenen's research, the so-called multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) has been incorporated into (inter-)national clinical guidelines as a first step to detect cancer when PSA-levels in the blood are elevated, resulting in fewer biopsies. \"One next step is the further development of mp-MRI, so that we can reliably detect or predict the presence of small metastases. In addition to anatomy, we also look at blood flow and the mobility of water, which is a measure of the density of tissue. The denser the tissue, the more aggressive the tumor. MRI can be made more quantitative and we are measuring more and more in 3D.\"\n\nMeasuring aggressiveness\nIn addition to protons in water and fat, Tom Scheenen also measures other atomic nuclei with MRI, such as phosphorus, fluorine, carbon and deuterium. \"The concentration of substances with these nuclei is often different in tumors than in healthy tissue. We are looking for a link between these so-called metabolites and the aggressiveness of a tumor, so their presence can help predicting cancer stage and prognosis.\" That in turn presents new technical challenges. \"As soon as we want to measure nuclei other than hydrogen, we need a different measuring device in the MRI scanner. We develop those special parts for our preclinical scanners ourselves, and for clinical use we collaborate with companies like Tesla Dynamic Coils and Rapid Biomedical.\"\n\nIn addition to the projects with companies, Tom Scheenen also works a lot with other research groups. \"Magnetic resonance is a broad topic, which interfaces with many other fields at the university and in the hospital. For instance, I am currently working on a project with the Department of Neurology on spectroscopy of the brain. Collaboration is always very welcome, both on our preclinical and clinical scanners, and both inside and outside the Radboudumc.\"\n\nCareer\nTom Scheenen (1974, Roggel) graduated cum laude in Molecular Sciences, with a specialization in Biophysics. He received his PhD from Wageningen University on his thesis titled 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Water Motion in Plants'. Since 2001, he has been working at the Department of Medical Imaging of the Radboudumc, with a six-month visit at the National Institutes of Health in the United States. Among others he received a VENI and several ERC grants. From 2006 he has been working one day a week at the Erwin L Hahn Institute in Essen.",
    "What are some strategies that businesses can take to deal with being short-staffed?\nToday\u2019s businesses, both large and small, are dealing with many issues related to being short-staffed. These complexities include overworked employees, low morale, poor customer service, and the inability to get everything done. Here are a few strategies for improving this nagging situation:\n\nStreamline. Determine which tasks are essential and which are not. Reallocate staff around the most critical areas, temporarily cutting those tasks that are less important until higher staffing levels can be achieved.\nOffer unique incentives. Attract and retain talent by providing enticing perks that employees wouldn\u2019t get anywhere else. Why not pay for their Netflix subscriptions, offer childcare stipends, send them free meal delivery, or offer reimbursements for their home office furniture? Get creative with your give and you\u2019ll draw more applicants in.\nRecruit younger talent and interns. Why not target high school students and college interns to pick up some of the slack? These young people are often looking for part-time work as well as opportunities to gain experience and a little extra money. Making them part of your recovery plan will certainly fill in some of the gaps.\nCreate a customer service strategy. When the number of employees decreases, so will the level of customer service. To minimize the impact, create a plan to ensure that the customer experience remains as pleasant as possible for your patrons. Find ways to entertain customers who are waiting in long lines or being placed on hold for an extended period of time. You can also offer discounts and perks for slow or unsatisfactory service. At the very least, train your staff regarding how to communicate with and treat inconvenienced customers.\nShow appreciation. Employees who are working under these lean conditions will experience a greater degree of stress and also have to deal with more annoyed and impatient customers. They\u2019ll be working longer and harder, too. As such, ensure that you show team members your appreciation (both verbally and with extra perks) and acknowledge the strain they\u2019re experiencing.\nHire part-time or remote employees. Perhaps there is a way to fill open positions with two part-time workers who can share one job. Job-sharing has a lot of benefits for both employers and employees. And, there are probably many tasks that can be delegated to remote workers who are willing to pick up a side gig to make a little extra money from home. Job-sharing and getting creative with allocating tasks can ensure your business continuity under these challenging conditions.",
    "Almost as abruptly as she had vanished, Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai reappeared in public view over the weekend.\n\nSince Friday evening, a steady stream of photos and videos purporting to show a smiling Peng going about her life in Beijing have surfaced on Twitter -- all posted by individuals working for Chinese government-controlled media and the state sport system, on a platform blocked in China.\nThe apparent propaganda push was followed Sunday by a video call between Peng and International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, during which the three-time Olympian insisted she is \"safe and well, living at her home in Beijing\" and \"would like to have her privacy respected,\" according to a statement from the IOC.\nThe flurry of \"proof of life\" videos came amid a firestorm of global concern for Peng, who disappeared from the public eye for more than two weeks after taking to social media to accuse former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of coercing her into sex at his home -- an explosive and politically sensitive allegation that triggered blanket censorship in China.\nWhile Peng's public reappearances may allay some of the worst fears about her immediate safety and well-being, they have failed to quell broader concerns about her freedoms and growing calls for a full investigation into her sexual assault allegations.\n\"It was good to see Peng Shuai in recent videos, but they don't alleviate or address the WTA's concern about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,\" a spokesperson for the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) told CNN in a statement, following Peng's call with the IOC. Human rights advocates who have long followed Beijing's silencing campaigns are also unconvinced.\n\"What we have here is essentially a state-controlled narrative: only the government and its affiliated media are generating and distributing the content about Peng's story,\" said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\"While it is possible that Peng is well, the history of the Chinese government disappearing people and then making videos of them to prove that they are unharmed when it is, in fact, the opposite, should make us worried about Peng's safety,\" she added.\nThe video clips appear to be specifically -- yet crudely -- crafted to show that Peng is \"free\" and living a \"normal\" life.\nIn footage released on Saturday, Peng was seen out to dinner with several people state media journalists have described as \"her coach and friends.\" The clips made repeated, deliberate references to the dates, while Peng kept nodding to the man speaking next to her, not saying anything.\nNone of the videos made even the vaguest mention of Peng's sexual assault allegations against Zhang. Instead, they focused on her smiles and apparent good-spirits -- which state media propagandists were eager to highlight. \"Can any girl fake such sunny smile under pressure?\" asked Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid the Global Times, in a tweet Sunday, accompanying a clip of a smiley Peng signing larged-sized tennis balls for children at a junior tennis match in Beijing.\n\"Those who suspect Peng Shuai is under duress, how dark they must be inside. There must be many, many forced political performances in their countries,\" Hu wrote on Twitter.\nThe Global Times, like other government-controlled media outlets in China, has made no reference to Peng's apparent disappearance, nor her allegations against Zhang. Hu has also been careful on Twitter not to mention the reason why Peng is in the spotlight, referring to it only obliquely as \"the thing people talked about.\"\nChinese authorities have not acknowledged Peng's allegations against Zhang, and there is no indication an investigation is underway. It remains unclear if Peng has reported her allegations to the police.\nSpeaking at a news conference Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian reiterated that Peng's accusation is not a diplomatic issue and declined to comment further.\nZhang has kept a low profile and faded from public life since his retirement in 2018, and there is no public information relating to his current whereabouts.\nSkepticism as to Peng's well-being especially runs high among Chinese activists who have observed from a close range how the government has silenced and coerced their peers.\n\"The reality is, they have huge control over Peng Shuai -- to the extent that it's enough to make her cooperate and become an actor,\" alleged Lv Pin, a prominent Chinese feminist now based in New York.\n\"This has happened in plenty of cases in the past. Many 'criminals' who were forced to confess on television had to make their performances look real,\" she said, referring to a series of forced confessions aired on state television, such as from Chinese human rights lawyers and the Hong Kong booksellers. Chinese authorities have so far elected not to place Peng on state television, perhaps aware that her presence -- even only on its English-language platforms -- would run counter to ongoing efforts to censor all discussions around her original allegations, and thus generate more questions within China than answers.\nInstead, Peng appeared in a 30-minute video call with IOC officials, accompanied by -- and under the close watch of -- a Chinese sports official who formerly served as the Communist Party secretary of the Tennis Administration Center of the General Administration of Sport of China.\nThe interview has not been reported by Chinese state media. But on its website, the IOC posted a statement and a photo of the call. It didn't release the full video, nor explain the circumstances surrounding the virtual meeting, including how it was arranged.\nAnd it appears that IOC officials have walked away from the meeting -- at least publicly -- concluding that Peng is OK.\n\"I was relieved to see that Peng Shuai was doing fine, which was our main concern,\" said Chair of the IOC Athletes' Commission Emma Terho, who joined the video call along with Li Lingwei, the Chinese sports official.\nBy drawing to quick conclusions about Peng's current state and avoiding any mention of her sexual assault allegations that ignited the whole controversy, analysts say the IOC is putting its own credibility on the line -- and potentially risks becoming complicit in Beijing's propaganda push.\n\"The IOC call hardly alleviates our concerns for Peng's well-being or safety,\" said Wang from the HRW.\n\"In fact, it begs the question of why the IOC appears to be participating in what is essentially a state-controlled narrative, as only the government and its affiliated media have been allowed to tell Peng's story.\"",
    "While Senate Democrats negotiate what to include in the party's sweeping $1.9 trillion budget reconciliation package, the price of almost everything is on the rise -- or at least feels like it is.\n\nThe legislation seeks to upgrade the nation's social safety net by extending several coronavirus relief programs and by creating new support systems, such as universal pre-K and health coverage for certain low-income adults. What measures will make it out of the Senate remains to be seen, however.\nAs lawmakers argue, Americans are struggling with skyrocketing inflation that is pushing up the price of food, gas, cars and other items. Major supply chain disruptions aren't helping, forcing consumers to pay more for some hard-to-find goods.\nBut tens of millions of people will see more money in their pockets thanks to increases in benefits and wages that are happening regardless of what Congress ends up doing.\nSocial Security payments\nSocial Security recipients will receive an annual cost of living adjustment of 5.9% next year, the largest increase since 1982.\nThe spike will boost retirees' monthly payments by $92 to an estimated average of $1,657 for 2022.\nIt's the largest adjustment that today's beneficiaries have seen, said Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst for The Senior Citizens League.\nThe roughly 70 million people who get Social Security, including retirees, Americans with disabilities and others, receive a cost of living adjustment, or COLA, each year. It's based on a one-year increase in inflation and is designed to help beneficiaries cope when prices rise.\nIn 2021, the adjustment was 1.3% -- which translated into a roughly $20 a month increase for retired workers.\nBut recipients should think twice before going on a spending spree amid soaring inflation because higher prices will wipe out part of the adjustment. What's more, Medicare Part B premiums for 2022 are also rising sharply, further cutting into their monthly Social Security checks.\nThe standard monthly Medicare Part B premium will be $170.10 next year, up from $148.50 for this year.\nMinimum wage\nWhile the federal minimum wage has remained $7.25 an hour since 2009, many states, cities and counties have raised their thresholds on their own.\nSome minimum wage workers receive a raise on or around New Year's Day every year thanks to automatic cost of living adjustments that are based on inflation. In some other locations, the wage steps up due to scheduled increases enacted in prior legislation.\nA total of 74 states, cities and counties raised their minimum wage during 2021, according to the National Employment Law Project, which is still tabulating the number for 2022 but expects it to be about the same.\nIn Arizona, for instance, the minimum hourly wage will be $12.80 in 2022, up from $12.15 this year. It inched up only 15 cents for 2021.\nMinimum hourly wage workers in Colorado will receive $12.56 next year, compared with $12.32 now. And the minimum hourly wage in Belmont, California, will rise to $16.20 come January, up from $15.90 currently.\n\"Cities, states and counties doing this on their own without waiting for the federal government obviously helps workers,\" said Yannet Lathrop, senior researcher at the law project. \"There is basically no state, city, county or region in the country where workers can survive on $7.25.\"\nAlso, the minimum wage for federal contractors will rise to $15 an hour during 2022, thanks to an executive order signed by President Joe Biden. It will take effect when new contracts are signed or when certain contract actions, such as extensions or renewals, are executed. An estimated 300,000 people will see a raise, according to Anastasia Christman, worker power program director at the law project.\nFood stamps\nFood stamp recipients are already receiving more monthly aid, which began with the new federal fiscal year in October.\nThe average monthly benefit rose to $251 per person, up from $240 per person -- even though a 15% federal boost authorized by Congress expired at the end of September.\nThe increase stems from a permanent update to the US Department of Agriculture's Thrifty Food Plan, which determines the benefit amount of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the formal name for food stamps. The review was required by the 2018 Farm Bill.\nRecipients also received a cost of living adjustment, which is based on food price inflation and kicks in every October. It amounts to $3 a month for the current fiscal year.\nThe current monthly benefit includes another coronavirus relief enhancement that Congress enacted last year and is still in effect in most states. Lawmakers raised enrollees' food stamp allotment to the maximum amount for their family size during the pandemic. Biden extended the measure earlier this year to an additional 25 million people in very low-income households who originally didn't receive the additional benefits.\nWithout this congressional measure, the average monthly benefit would be $169.\nNearly 41.7 million people were receiving food stamps as of August, according to the most recent federal data.",
    "The Pythagoras theorem which is also sometimes referred the Pythagorean theorem is the most important formula of a geometry branch. According to Pythagoras, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides of a triangle. In this lesson, you will learn about the Pythagoras theorem, its derivations, and equations followed by solved real-world problems on the Pythagoras theorem triangle and squares.\n\nWhat Is Pythagoras Theorem?\nThe Pythagoras theorem states that if a triangle is right-angled (90 degrees), then the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In the given triangle ABC, we have BC2 = AB2 + AC2\u200b\u200b. Here, \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAB is the base, AC is the altitude or the height, and BC is the hypotenuse.

In this lesson, you will learn about the Pythagoras theorem, its derivations, and equations followed by solved real-world problems on the Pythagoras theorem triangle and squares.\n\nWhat Is Pythagoras Theorem?\nThe Pythagoras theorem states that if a triangle is right-angled (90 degrees), then the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In the given triangle ABC, we have BC2 = AB2 + AC2\u200b\u200b. Here, \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAB is the base, AC is the altitude or the height, and BC is the hypotenuse. History of Pythagoras Theorem\nPythagoras theorem was introduced by the Greek Mathematician Pythagoras of Samos. He was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher. He started a group of mathematicians who works religiously on numbers and lived like monks. Finally, the Greek Mathematician stated the theorem hence it is called by his name as the \"Pythagoras theorem.\" Though it was introduced many centuries ago its application in the current era is obligatory to deal with pragmatic situations.\n\nAlthough Pythagoras introduced and popularised the theorem, there is sufficient evidence proving its existence in other civilizations, 1000 years before Pythagoras was born. The oldest known evidence dates back to between 20th to 16th Century B.C in the Old Babylonian Period.\n\nPythagoras Theorem Formula\nThe Pythagoras theorem formula states that in a right triangle ABC, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the other two legs. If AB, BC, and AC are the sides of the triangle, then: BC2 = AB2 + AC2\u200b. While if a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, then \u200bc2 = a2 + b2. In this case, we can say that AB is the base, AC is the altitude or the height, and BC is the hypotenuse.\n\nPythagoras Theorem Proof\nPythagoras theorem can be proved in many ways. Some of the most common and most widely used methods are by using the algebraic method proof and using the similar triangles method to solve them. Let us have a look at both of these methods individually in order to understand the proof of this theorem.\n\nAlgebraic Method Proof of Pythagoras Theorem\nPythagoras Theorem Proof using Similar Triangles\nAlgebraic Method Proof of Pythagoras Theorem\nAlgebraic method proof of Pythagoras theorem will help us in deriving the proof of the Pythagoras Theorem by using the values of a, b, and c (values of the measures of the side lengths corresponding to sides BC, AC, and AB respectively). Consider four right triangles ABC where b is the base, a is the height and c is the hypotenuse. Arrange these four congruent right triangles in the given square, whose side is a + b. The area of the square so formed by arranging the four triangles is c2. The area of a square with side (a + b) = Area of 4 triangles + Area of square with side c. This implies (a + b)2 = 4\u00d71/2\u00d7(a\u00d7b)+ c2, a2 + b2 + 2ab = 2ab + c2. Therefore, a2 + b2 = c2. Hence Proved.\n\nPythagoras Theorem Proof using Similar Triangles\nTwo triangles are said to be similar if their corresponding angles are of equal measures and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio. Also, if the angles are of the same measure, then we can say by using the sine law, that the corresponding sides will also be in the same ratio. Hence, corresponding angles in similar triangles will lead us to equal ratios of side lengths. In triangle ABD and triangle ACB:\n\n\u2220A = \u2220A (common)\n\u2220ADB = \u2220ABC (both are right angles)\nThus, triangle ABD and triangle ACB are equiangular, which means that they are similar by AA similarity criterion. Similarly, we can prove triangle BCD similar to triangle ACB. Since triangles ABD and ACB are similar, we have AD/AB = AB/AC. Thus we can say that AD \u00d7 AC = AB2. Similarly, triangles BCD and ACB are similar. That gives us CD/BC = BC/AC. Thus, we can also say that CD \u00d7 AC = BC2. Now, using both of these similarity equations, we can say that AC2 = AB2 + BC2. Hence Proved.\n\nPythagoras Theorem Triangles\nRight triangles follow the rule of the Pythagoras theorem and they are called Pythagoras theorem triangles. The length of all the three sides are being collectively called Pythagoras triples. For example, 3, 4, and 5 can be called as one of the sets of such triangles. There are a lot more right-angled triangles which are called Pythagoras triangles. All such triangles follow one common rule: c2 = a2 + b2.\n\nPythagoras Theorem Squares\nAs per the Pythagorean theorem Hypotenuse2 = Perpendicular2 + Base2 or c2 = a2 + b2, which further justifies that the area of the square built upon the hypotenuse of a right triangle will be equal to the sum of the area of the squares built upon the other two sides. And these squares are known as Pythagoras squares.\n\nApplications of Pythagoras Theorem\nThough it is necessary to learn the basic concepts such as theorem statements and their mathematical representation, we would be more curious in understanding the applications of the Pythagoras theorem which we face in day-to-day life situations.\n\nHere are some of the applications of the Pythagoras Theorem\n\nEngineering and Construction fields\nMost architects use the technique of the Pythagorean theorem to find the value as well as when length or breadth are known it is very easy to calculate the diameter of a particular sector. It is mainly used in two dimensions in engineering fields.\n\nFace recognition in security cameras\nWe are more familiar with face recognition nowadays it reduces the turmoil in investigating the crimes in the security areas. It undergoes the concept of the Pythagorean theorem that is, the distance between the security camera and the place where the person is noted is well projected through the lens using the concept.\n\nWoodworking and interior designing\nAs the main concept indicates if the cardboards being square can be made into a triangle easily by cutting diagonally then very easily the Pythagoras concept can be applied. Most woodworks are made on the strategy which makes it easier for designers to proceed.\n\nNavigation\nIt's a very amazing fact but people traveling in the sea use this technique to find the shortest distance and route to proceed to their concerned places.\n\nSurveying\nUsually, surveyors use this technique to find the steep mountainous region, knowing the horizontal region it would be easier for them to calculate the rest using the Pythagoras concept. The fixed distance and the varying one can be looked through a telescope by the surveyor which makes the path easier.\n\n\u261b Related Articles\n\nIf you want to build more conceptual knowledge with the help of practical illustrations try Pythagoras Theorem Worksheets.

    "Nijmegen is situated on the banks of the Waal, a branch of the Rhine in the region of the \u2018Great Rivers\u2019, and a mere 10 kilometers from the German border. Of Roman origin (its name derives from 'Noviomagus' meaning 'new market') the city celebrated its 2000th anniversary in 2005. This makes Nijmegen the oldest city in the Netherlands(verwijst naar een andere website). Nijmegen was also the imperial residence during the Carolingian period. The 'Valkhof' - \u2018Falcon\u2019s Court\u2019 - is the highest point of the city overlooking the river. It was once the site of Charlemagne\u2019s castle. From this vantage point, which is now a scenic park, the typically Dutch polder landscape and rolling hills provide a beautiful panorama.\n\nThe Great Rivers marked the northern frontier of the Roman Empire, and no doubt the Romans settled here because of the splendid strategic view of enemy territory across the river. For similarly strategic reasons, subsequent kings and other rulers chose Nijmegen as their place of residence. Until a century ago, Nijmegen was a fortified town, its surroundings were the scene of many fierce battles. However, in 1879 the old city defences were torn down, as they posed an increasing obstacle to the city's prosperity. A period of spectacular growth followed, and within a few decades the railway bridge across the Waal was constructed, and gas, electricity and water mains were installed in the city.\n\nThe Second World War is a black page in Nijmegen's history. On February 22, 1944 allied forces bombed the city by mistake, killing 800 people. A few months later, Nijmegen was liberated following the U.S. airborne landings of \u2018Operation Market Garden\u2019, which freed the southern part of the Netherlands on September 17, 1944. Badly damaged in the war, much was done to rebuild the city in the post-war period and a new city centre arose in which the remaining monuments of Nijmegen\u2019s rich history occupy a special position.",
    "Kiley Reid\u2019s Such a Fun Age, the Vox Book Club\u2019s pick for November, takes place in a very specific age indeed. It\u2019s 2015, the lead-up to the 2016 election. President Barack Obama is in office, Hillary Clinton is expected to be the next president, and pundits are given to smugly declaring America to be post-racist and post-sexist.\n\nAs Such a Fun Age shows, that was never truly the case. This novel is a satire of polite liberal prejudices, and how they flourish beneath a veneer of colorblind civility.\n\nSuch a Fun Age concerns 25-year-old Emira. She\u2019s Black, a recent college grad, and struggling to figure out what she wants to do with the rest of her life. Her 26th birthday is approaching, which means she\u2019s about to get kicked off her parents\u2019 health insurance, so she\u2019s got a ticking clock on this problem.\n\nBut all Emira really likes doing is hanging out with Briar, her 3-year-old white babysitting charge. Emira has tried to imagine getting a permanent nannying position with another family so she can get her own health care, but it\u2019s not children in the abstract she likes: it\u2019s Briar specifically, who is smart and deadpan funny and never stops asking questions.\n\nWhat Emira likes less is Briar\u2019s mother, Alix. And it\u2019s with Alix that Reid\u2019s satire gets most pointed.\n\nAlix exists as an all-too realistic parody of Lean In white feminism. She\u2019s a sort of proto-influencer who built her brand in the \u201900s by writing handwritten letters to companies asking for free products, receiving them, and then blogging about the result. Now, she\u2019s an Instagrammer who runs a coaching business teaching women how to ask for what they want \u2014 so long as they are nice, upper-middle-class women who ask politely, respectfully, and on expensive stationery. Her signature hashtag is #LetHerSpeak.\n\nThe tell that Alix\u2019s interest in letting women speak is phony comes early on, when we enter her point of view and learn what she thinks of Briar. Alix is viscerally annoyed by Briar\u2019s voice, which is \u201cloud and hoarse\u201d and \u201cconsumed everything in its path.\u201d Briar seems more unruly to Alix than other children her age, less respectable in her curiosity and desires. So though Alix is happy to use Briar as a prop \u2014 breastfeeding her from the stage during an event in order to leverage a viral moment, positioning herself as the icon of the modern mom who has it all \u2014 she prefers not to pay too much attention to Briar on a day-to-day basis. That\u2019s why she hires Emira.\n\nAnd Alix finds herself fascinated by Emira, much more than she is fascinated by Briar. She wants Emira to use her youth and Blackness and beauty to validate Alix, to affirm that since Alix has a close Black friend and her favorite shoes are from Payless, she\u2019s still cool. She wants, also, to \u201csave\u201d Emira from herself, to teach her how to polish her self-presentation and redo her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and start writing handwritten cover letters on beautiful creamy stationery.\n\nEmira isn\u2019t particularly interested in any of that, though. She mostly just wants health care, and she wants to be thought of as a human rather than as a prop in white people\u2019s performances of progressivism. That\u2019s why her closest relationship is with Briar, who loves her with a deep and specific gravity. It\u2019s also why she doesn\u2019t care for Alix, who treats her as a trophy \u2014 and why she\u2019s more than a little wary of her own white boyfriend, Kelley.\n\nWhile Alix is an obvious villain, a cringey tryhard who might as well be the living embodiment of A White Woman\u2019s Instagram, Kelley is a more ambiguous character. We never get inside his head, as we do with Alix, but we can see from the outside that he\u2019s self-confident and genuinely pretty cool, someone easy to like.\n\nBut Kelley also, Emira notes with some surprise, seems to only date Black women and have Black friends. He drops the n-word in casual conversation, hard r and all. When Emira talks about racism, he seems very eager to prove that he \u201cgets it,\u201d but she isn\u2019t at all sure that he does. He seems to savor his outrage over her situation in a way she keeps thinking is maybe a little off-putting.\n\nKelley and Alix, we eventually learn, have a history. It\u2019s left them resentful of each other \u2014 and also eager to use Emira as a pawn in the contest Alix mentally labels Which One of Us Is Actually More Racist?\n\nAnd so Such a Fine Age winds up with Emira, now extricated from both Alix and Kelley, thinking not of them but of Briar. Briar was the only person Emira could be sure genuinely loved her in her whole time as a babysitter \u2014 but Emira fears that stuck alone with her neglectful mother and all the privileges of whiteness, Briar, too, will come to outsource her emotional labor to someone she can hire. In the world of liberal racism, the problem isn\u2019t hate so much as it is unthinking and callous fetishism.",
    "The House of Representatives on Friday passed Democrats\u2019 sweeping $1.85 trillion climate and social spending bill, a huge and historic investment in early childhood education, clean energy, and other measures.\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the Build Back Better Act (BBB), would dedicate substantial funding to universal pre-K, provide child care subsidies covering roughly 20 million children, and extend an expanded child tax credit for one more year. Additionally, it includes the largest investment in clean energy \u2014 predominately in the form of tax credits \u2014 that the federal government has ever made.\n\nThe bill is a key part of President Joe Biden\u2019s first-year agenda, and it now heads to the Senate, where it\u2019s expected to get pared back due to the opposition moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) have expressed to provisions including paid leave. Its passage in the House, however, is a notable step and an important sign of progress given how long lawmakers have been at an impasse over the legislation.\n\nFriday\u2019s vote follows months of Democratic disagreements over what to include in the bill and what to cut.\n\nMost recently, five House moderates refused to vote on the legislation until it received a score from the Congressional Budget Office estimating its impact on spending and revenue. They signaled, too, that they might not vote for the bill as written if that score failed to align with the White House\u2019s own analysis.\n\nAfter receiving an estimate on Thursday, which found that the bill would add roughly $160 billion to the debt over 10 years, several of these lawmakers wound up supporting the legislation.\n\nThe $160 billion estimate factors in $207 billion in funding that the CBO thinks the government will bring in from additional IRS enforcement. Without this revenue, the CBO estimates that the bill would add $367 billion to the debt over a decade.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, citing analyses by the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee for Taxation, said this week that the bill would be fully paid for, and actually reduce the debt over time. There are some discrepancies between the CBO and White House numbers, however, one of the largest being estimates for IRS enforcement revenue \u2014 which the administration put at $480 billion instead of $207 billion.\n\nHouse moderates\u2019 backing is vital due to Democrats\u2019 narrow majority in the House, which means the party can lose only three votes in the passage of this bill. With moderate support, the legislation got the simple majority it ultimately needed to pass 220-213 along party lines, though Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) still defected. No Republicans, who\u2019ve broadly criticized the bill for its expansive size, supported the vote, which took place following a lengthy speech made by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nDespite this movement in the House, however, there are no guarantees about the bill\u2019s future in the Senate. Because moderate senators including Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re backing the legislation yet, it\u2019s possible the bill could see significant changes before becoming law.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the Build Back Better Act\nAs it stands, the roughly $1.85 trillion legislation (one estimate put the House bill spending total as high as $2.4 trillion) concentrates most of its funding on early childhood care and education as well as climate spending.\n\nMajor provisions of the House package \u2014 and spending estimates calculated by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget \u2014 currently include:\n\n$570 billion for climate-related provisions (including clean energy tax credits)\n$380 billion for universal pre-K and child care subsidies\n$275 billion for an increase to the SALT cap\n$205 billion for a four-week paid leave program\n$190 billion for a one-year extension of the expanded child tax credit and making it fully refundable permanently\n$175 billion for the maintenance and construction of affordable housing\n$150 billion for long-term home health care\n$120 billion to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits\n$35 billion to expand Medicare coverage to include hearing services\nAlong with major investments in the social safety net and clean energy, Democrats have used the bill to address their long-held policy goal of enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The legislation would allow the federal government to renegotiate how much Medicare pays for 10 drugs in the near term, a change that\u2019s expected to help lower costs significantly \u2014 not just for the government, but for all of those who need those medicines \u2014 given the leverage that Medicare has.\n\nTo raise revenue to cover the new spending, the legislation contains a slew of changes to the tax code targeting corporations and wealthier individuals. These provisions include a new 15 percent minimum tax rate for corporations, a 1 percent surcharge on corporate stock buybacks, and an additional 8 percent surtax for those making more than $25 million in income.\n\nAnother more contentious tax update \u2014 a change to the SALT provision \u2014 adds about $275 billion in spending to the bill, and would mostly benefit wealthier individuals. The change was demanded by certain Democratic leaders who argued for it because they feel their constituents face significant tax burdens, which are higher in some left-leaning states. The update, which would alter the amount of state and local tax deductions (SALT) individuals could take, would raise the cap of that deduction from $10,000 to $80,000 for the next few years.\n\nOverall, this legislation is still quite expansive, but pretty different from the $3.5 trillion social and climate spending proposal Democrats introduced earlier this year. Because of moderate pushback, programs including free two-year community college education and the expansion of Medicare coverage for dental and vision services, along with increases to the top corporate tax rate, have been stripped out completely. And immigration reform measures and other provisions in the House bill may not make it through the Senate.\n\nWhat the CBO said about the bill\u2019s cost\nThe Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimates suggest the bill would add roughly $160 billion to the national debt between 2022-2031, if IRS enforcement revenue was factored in. It\u2019s an analysis that differs from the estimates made by the White House, though a key discrepancy is due to divergent estimates about the IRS enforcement figures, which was anticipated.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s report indicates that the measure\u2019s revenue raisers, including a new tax on stock buybacks and savings from prescription drug negotiations, would be enough to cover most if not all of the bill\u2019s costs. Overall, the CBO estimates that the bill includes about $1.63 trillion in spending and $1.47 trillion in revenue (including the IRS enforcement money), meaning about $160 billion isn\u2019t covered by the pay-fors.\n\nThough the CBO\u2019s data showed that the legislation\u2019s spending isn\u2019t fully addressed by new revenue, its analysis gave some moderate hold-outs in the House the assurances they need to move forward on the bill since most of its figures were in line with the White House\u2019s.\n\nPreviously, analyses from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House indicated that the revenue the legislation generated would largely match its spending.\n\nAn estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation suggested the measure would bring in about $1.5 trillion in revenue over a decade. That calculation did not include more recently added provisions, like policies to cut prescription drug costs, that are expected to bring in further revenue. Another estimate from the Treasury Department concluded that the full suite of pay-fors including tax increases and drug cost savings would bring in up to $2.2 trillion in 10 years, fully covering the entirety of the bill.\n\nFollowing the CBO report, the White House has emphasized that it\u2019s even more confident about the legislation\u2019s revenue raisers. \u201cThe combination of CBO & JCT\u2019s scores over the last week and Treasury analysis make it clear that Build Back Better is fully paid for, and in fact will reduce our nation\u2019s debt over time through $2 trillion+ in revenue raisers and other savings,\u201d Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen posted in a tweet on Thursday.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s estimate of the costs of the bill wound up being lower than what the White House projected, while the revenue that it estimated from prescription drug cost savings was actually higher. Since the White House also expects revenue from IRS enforcement to be more than the CBO\u2019s estimates, it\u2019s told House members it doesn\u2019t expect the bill to add to the debt.",

    "Gig economy workers to get employee rights under EU proposals\nDraft legislation would improve status of millions of workers, with likely knock-on effect on UK despite Brexit\n\nDutch company Just Eat Takeaway offers employee status to workers who have been on the platform for more than 100 hours. Photograph: Robin Utrecht/Rex/Shutterstock\nGig economy companies operating in the European Union, such as Uber and Deliveroo, must ensure workers get the minimum wage, access to sick pay, holidays and other employment rights under plans for new laws to crack down on fake self-employment.\n\nPublishing long-awaited draft legislation on Thursday, the European Commission said the burden of proof on employment status would shift to companies, rather than the individuals that work for them. Until now, gig economy workers have had to go to court to prove they are employees, or risk being denied basic rights.\n\nNicolas Schmit, EU commissioner for jobs and social rights, told the Guardian and other European newspapers that internet platforms \u201chave used grey zones in our legislation [and] all possible ambiguities\u201d to develop their business models, resulting in a \u201cmisclassification\u201d of millions of workers.\n\nIn the EU\u2019s 27 member states, about 5.5 million workers are misclassified as self-employed, when they should be treated as employees with benefits and protection, such as accident insurance, according the commission. Firms would only have to pay minimum wages, where they already exist. About 28 million people work for platforms in the EU, but this is expected to reach 43 million by 2025.\n\nThe proposals are an attempt to provide legal certainty, after European courts have been asked to settle about 100 disputes relating to gig economy companies. France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal tightened up domestic laws, but EU officials believe no government has fully addressed the problem.\n\nSince Brexit, the UK government has no obligation to follow EU laws, while judges have been left to clarify employment law for a new generation of internet companies. In 2016 an employment court found that Uber drivers are not self-employed and should be paid the minimum wage, a verdict upheld by the supreme court in February.\n\nTim Sharp, senior employment rights policy officer at the Trades Union Congress, said there had not been any \u201csignificant government intervention in the UK\u201d to address what unions see as abusive and problematic aspects of platform working.\n\n\u201cIf the European Union is seen to be taking a robust approach on platform operators, I think there will be more pressure on the government here to take measures to protect vulnerable workers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EU proposals will be amended by national ministers and MEPs before they become law.\n\nSchmit, a former labour minister in his native Luxembourg, said some services might cost \u201ca bit more\u201d, but argued consumer convenience should not be at the expense of workers.\n\nServices, such as food delivery, were not free, he said. \u201cI cannot consider if somebody brings the pizza at 11 o\u2019clock in the evening to my home \u2026 that I have not to pay for that. This is a service. And if it\u2019s a service, the guy who performs the service has also rights.\u201d\n\nUnder the directive, workers would also gain rights over algorithms, to stop situations where people are denied jobs, working hours or even fired as a result of machines\u2019 decisions. Instead, workers would have the right to receive explanations for and contest automated decisions, while companies would have to ensure access to a human contact for anything that would have a significant impact on the person.\n\nCompanies that did not allow people to work for other firms, or had rules about appearance and how to carry out tasks, could be classed as employers, under the proposals.\n\nThe European Trade Union Confederation\u2019s Ludovic Voet said the directive should \u201csignal the end of the free for all\u201d for companies such as Uber, Deliveroo and others. \u201cFor too long platform companies have made huge profits by dodging their most basic obligations as employers at the expense of workers while peddling the lie that they provided choice to workers,\u201d he said.\n\nCompanies in the gig economy have taken different approaches. Just Eat Takeaway, a Dutch company that is one of the world\u2019s biggest food delivery firms, announced last year that gig workers would become employees with benefits.\n\nMoveEU, a body representing ride-hailing apps, such as Uber, has argued EU action could cost jobs. \u201cPlatform work is very diverse, and a one-size-fits-all approach could carry weight on the business model of platforms and ultimately negatively affect the many independent workers relying on them,\u201d it said in a recent paper.\n\nGeorge Maier, a specialist on digital technology at the London School of Economics, said companies would have to adapt to stay in markets. \u201cFor a lot of these platforms, because they are realising their model is not profitable, there is a big question over what change they can do and what change they can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have seen some evidence of platforms trying to get around the tightening grip of legislation by changing their business model. The alternative is to pull out of a country where they don\u2019t see a profitable future.\u201d\n\n\u2026 as you're joining us from the Netherlands, we have a small favour to ask.

    "Jimmy Lai and two other Hong Kong democracy activists found guilty over June 4 assembly\n\nMedia tycoon Jimmy Lai is escorted into a Hong Kong Correctional Services van outside the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong on February 1, 2021.\nHong KongA Hong Kong court found three prominent pro-democracy activists guilty on Thursday of unauthorized assembly over a June 4 vigil last year to mark Beijing's 1989 crackdown on protesters in and around Tiananmen Square.\n\nHong Kong has traditionally held the world's largest annual June 4 vigils, as part of wide-ranging freedoms promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, but the last two were banned by police, citing coronavirus curbs.\nThe ruling against media tycoon Jimmy Lai, barrister Chow Hang-tung and former opposition politician Gwyneth Ho is the latest blow to the democracy movement, in which scores of activists have been arrested, jailed or fled since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law.\nLai, Chow and Ho had pleaded not guilty to the charges linked to the gathering on June 4, 2020.\nChow Hang-tung poses after an interview in Hong Kong on May 24, 2021. \n\nProsecutors had been \"able to prove beyond reasonable doubt\" that Lai and Chow had incited others to attend the vigil, District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock wrote in her judgment.\nThese efforts included an appeal by Chow for people to \"light candles\" all over Hong Kong, including the usual vigil site of Victoria Park.\nLai was held guilty despite appearing in the park for just 15 minutes in what Woodcock called a \"deliberate act to rally support for and publicly spotlight the unauthorized assembly that followed,\" even if he did not speak.\nHo was found guilty of participating in an unauthorized assembly.\nDuring the trial, Chow, a former leader of the now disbanded Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, had argued the annual vigil was \"their right, their freedom.\"\nHo earlier told the court that \"remembrance is resistance,\" adding she only went to the site to test the difference between Hong Kong and mainland China, where any commemoration of June 4 is taboo and can lead to imprisonment.\nPro-democracy activist Gwyneth Ho, who was banned from standing in upcoming local elections, poses with her disqualification notice at her office in Hong Kong on August 4, 2020.\nSixteen other activists are already serving sentences of between four and 10 months for the same incident.\nAfter mass pro-democracy protests in 2019, China imposed a sweeping national security law that punishes offenses such as subversion and secession with jail terms of up to life.\nCritics, including the United States government, say the law has been used as a tool to erode the city's freedoms and quash dissent, but Beijing says it has brought stability and order to the financial hub.\nChow and several former leaders of the now disbanded Alliance, which had long sought to \"end one-party rule,\" have also been charged with inciting subversion under the new law.\nChina has never given a full account of the 1989 crackdown. Days later officials put the death toll at about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands may have been killed.",
    "Behind the chaos and scandal of Boris Johnson\u2019s government lies stasis\n\nEditor's note (December 8th 2021): This article has been updated.\n\nTHE SECOND anniversary of Boris Johnson\u2019s election landslide, falling on December 12th, is an unhappy one. On December 7th a junior diplomat-turned-whistleblower laid bare the chaos that surrounded the British evacuation of Kabul in evidence to MPs. The prime minister denied the claim that he personally ordered the airlift of pet dogs as eligible Afghans were left behind. The same day a video emerged of Downing Street aides and press officers joking about a Christmas party held in breach of lockdown a year ago; two days later Allegra Stratton, who was seen laughingly suggesting that the event had been work-related, resigned. The prime minister, implausibly, declared he was shocked and announced an investigation. And all the while, concerns grow about the spread of the Omicron variant of covid-19. On December 8th rules on mask-wearing and guidance on working from home were strengthened, though Christmas gatherings can still go ahead\u2014for now.\n\n\nSuch evidence of arrogance, incompetence and poor judgment would reflect badly on any government. But this one has shrugged off bad press before\u2014including over lockdown breaches, such as a jaunt last year to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot, by Dominic Cummings, then Mr Johnson\u2019s chief aide. Labour, the main opposition party, has failed to open up the clear poll lead required by Britain\u2019s unequal electoral geography for it to form a majority government (see chart). What leaves Mr Johnson\u2019s supporters despairing is less crisis than stasis. On many fronts, the revolution he promised during Brexit negotiations and on the campaign trail in 2019 has stalled. The idea that Johnsonism could be a new model of government, like Thatcherism and Blairism, looks far-fetched.\n\nThe working Tory majority of 87 seats in 2019 was an electoral revolution. It was followed by constitutional revolution, as Britain left the EU. For the \u201cpeople\u2019s government\u201d of self-styled radicals prone to quoting Gramsci and Lenin, that was only the beginning. A revolution in steel and concrete would \u201clevel up\u201d Britain\u2019s economic geography. A cultural revolution would vanquish elites on behalf of blue-collar voters. A march through the institutions would bring the civil service, courts and quangos to heel.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s ideological victory is total: only a brave few now advocate rejoining the EU or champion cities over towns. But Brexit has become a frozen conflict. David Frost, the chief EU negotiator, is seeking to renegotiate the divorce treaty, and the promised new relationship with Europe is nowhere in sight. EU trade deals have been replicated but no big new deals signed. Nor, to Lord Frost\u2019s frustration, has regulation diverged from EU models.\n\nMr Cummings had started work on new subsidy and procurement rules and a looser immigration regime for scientists, but since his exit in late 2020 such policy innovation has ground to a halt. An experimental replacement for EU payments to farmers is still embryonic, even as existing subsidies are withdrawn. Three hefty reforms of Mr Johnson\u2019s government\u2014an online-safety bill, tougher screening of foreign investment and tighter competition rules governing tech giants\u2014are legacies of his predecessor, Theresa May. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has shied away from structural tax reform.\n\nAs for \u201clevelling up\u201d, what started as an aspiration to close the productivity gap between north and south has become a slogan for almost any state activity outside London. A policy paper has been delayed. Ministers disagree on devolution. Having promised an infrastructure boom, last month Mr Johnson cut back ambitious plans for new railways in the north.\n\nThe government has bashed and battered institutions, but not remade or reformed them. Mr Cummings hankered to break up the permanent civil service, and his tenure saw some senior figures squeezed out. Yet they were replaced by Whitehall lifers, and what remains of the reform programme is consensual and conventional. Ministers have dreamed since the 1960s of relocating civil servants outside London, bringing in more tech skills and improving training, notes Alex Thomas of the Institute for Government. A war on Scottish separatism, led by a combative \u201cUnion Unit\u201d in Downing Street, has been wound down, to the relief of Scots Tories who thought it counterproductive. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, lobs insults at BBC bosses but has no serious plan for public-service broadcasting.\n\nWho betrayed the revolution? Covid-19 derailed Mr Johnson\u2019s premiership, occupying tens of thousands of civil servants, burning political capital with MPs and sending borrowing in 2021 to \u00a3320bn ($424bn, 15.2% of GDP). Little surprise, then, that the Treasury has emerged as a major constraint on Mr Johnson\u2019s aspirations. It has plumped up departmental budgets, but balked at signing cheques for levelling up. Adult social care, a supposed beneficiary of politically costly tax rises, will remain underfunded as the extra cash goes on the pandemic health-care backlog. Bringing net carbon emissions down to zero is Mr Johnson\u2019s most ambitious target, but the Treasury is reluctant to use the tax system to encourage behavioural change.\n\nSounds like a whisper\nFor true radicals, Conservative voters can look like the enemy within. The next election will be a defensive operation to hold seats won in 2019, which means jettisoning policies that would disrupt the lives of older voters in provincial towns. A liberalisation of planning rules has been parked; loosening food standards, which would allow a more ambitious trade policy, is off-limits. In their place are simplistic responses to complex problems, such as promises of tougher sentencing for child-abusers, and headline-friendly policies such as stricter pet-welfare laws.\n\nBut the main culprits are in Downing Street, which is as callow as the leaked video of staff sniggering about a cheese-and-wine party suggests. Ministers want Mr Johnson to draft in an old hand to lead its inexperienced staff. Mr Cummings wanted it to be a panopticon, monitoring Whitehall performance from a NASA-style control room. Instead it is kept in the dark by ministers and preoccupied with internal politics. Like any good revolutionary, Mr Johnson believed that intractable problems, such as regional inequality and irregular migration, could be solved by sheer willpower. Caution was scorned as gloomsterism. \u201cGovernment is boring,\u201d says a colleague, \u201cand for him it is excruciating.\u201d\n\nFar from matching Margaret Thatcher in transformation and vision, Mr Johnson is proving less dynamic than David Cameron, his rival at Eton and Oxford. Mr Cameron\u2019s career ended in ignominy after he called, and lost, a referendum on Europe, but he made significant reforms to education, devolution and the civil service. It is neither scandals over cheese-and-wine parties, nor even the risk of electoral defeat, that keeps Tory radicals awake at night. It is the opportunity offered by a landslide victory being wasted.",
    "A proposed bill on conversion therapy could do more harm than good\n\nIN 2013 A Conservative government legalised same-sex marriage. It was the latest step in the social liberalisation of Britain that started in the 1960s, and in the Conservatives\u2019 own modernisation. Despite opposition at the time, within the party the result is now regarded as uncontroversial.\n\nNow another Conservative government is seeking its own modernising moment. A short public consultation on banning \u201cconversion therapy\u201d closes on December 10th, with the aim of passing a law before an international conference on gay and trans issues in London next June. Supporters say it is needed to end a practice that harms sexual minorities; opponents, that it may worsen the harms it aims to end.\n\nThe plan is to create a criminal offence covering therapy undertaken with the intention of changing a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. It is supported by campaign groups; the chief executive of one, Stonewall, regards it as so obviously right that she opposed consulting the public at all. But critics point to three problems: its conflation of gay and trans identities; a poor evidence base; and the introduction of \u201cgender identity\u201d into law.\n\nEfforts to turn gay people straight by prayer, exhortation or \u201caversive therapy\u201d such as electric shocks were common until the 1960s, when homosexual acts between men were still illegal. But being gay is now widely accepted as both unproblematic and innate, and such treatments as not only cruel but doomed to failure. To the extent that they still happen, it is largely in religious settings and consists of laying-on of hands and the like, rather than physical abuse (which is in any case already illegal). \u201cThere are no legitimate, registered psychotherapists now who would be part of persuading someone they are not gay,\u201d says David Bell, a psychiatrist who wrote a critical report in 2018 about GIDS, England\u2019s specialist gender clinic for children.\n\nTrans conversion therapy (which the proposed law does not define) is a different matter\u2014not because trans people are inherently problematic, any more than gay people are, but because unlike sexual orientation, gender identity is neither well-defined nor necessarily stable. \u201cConflating the two is incredibly dangerous,\u201d says Anna Hutchinson, a clinical psychologist who used to work at GIDS. A person may dissociate from their biological sex for a host of reasons, including autistic-spectrum disorders, depression, trauma or a history of sexual abuse. Responsible clinical practice requires investigating such possibilities. But the phrase \u201ctrans conversion therapy\u201d is being used to mean any approach other than immediately affirming a person\u2019s stated gender, says Dr Hutchinson. \u201cThat goes against what therapy is.\u201d\n\nThe only safeguard is an acknowledgement that talking therapy may be appropriate if a patient is \u201cquestioning their LGBT status\u201d. But \u201clots of my patients are not questioning; they are very assertive that they are trans,\u201d says Susan Thompson (not her real name), a family doctor who insists on exploring all comorbidities with trans-identifying patients. \u201cThe way this is worded at the moment, I could end up in prison,\u201d she says. Even if there are few prosecutions, the law would make medical professionals wary of anything but unquestioning affirmation. It would also reinforce a trend for schools to go along with cross-sex identities asserted by children, sometimes without even telling parents.\n\nThe second complaint about the bill is the poor quality of the evidence upon which it is based. A government-commissioned report by researchers at Coventry University attempts to show that trans conversion therapy is similar to attempts to \u201cpray the gay away\u201d. But that conclusion does not follow from the very limited research presented. The report relies on a handful of articles and interviews, none of which establishes evidence of harm. Much is made of an online perception survey based on a six-minute fictional video clip, and a single question in a unrepresentative survey by an American transgender lobby group. The growing number of \u201cdetransitioners\u201d\u2014people who identify as trans, only later to change their mind\u2014is ignored.\n\nThe third big complaint is that the proposals would introduce the nebulous concept of \u201cgender identity\u201d to British law for the first time. In 2020 a grass-roots campaign by feminists succeeded in forcing the government to abandon plans to allow anyone to change their legal sex at will. That would, in effect, have made self-described gender identity the deciding factor in who counted legally as a man or a woman, abolishing single-sex spaces and services at a stroke. The plans are \u201ca smoke screen for bringing gender-identity ideology into law,\u201d says Maya Forstater, one of the founders of Sex Matters, an organisation campaigning for sex-based rights.\n\nThe consultation comes as an independent review of gender-identity services for children is under way, led by Hillary Cass, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Findings are expected next year. \u201cWhy not wait until after Cass is published?\u201d asks Dr Bell. But the government faces a dilemma. It wants to appeal to younger voters by showing it is not stodgy, while also signalling to socially conservative older and working-class voters that it is not too \u201cwoke\u201d.\n\nThis complicates a second U-turn on trans issues in quick succession. And if the bill goes before Parliament in its current form, MPs may fear voting against it, even though many Conservatives and growing numbers on the Labour benches are uneasy. Few voters realise how much is concealed by the phrase \u201cconversion therapy\u201d, and MPs may fear being smeared as bigots.\n\nPerhaps most worrying is the impact on children. Many, it seems, are interpreting the stirrings of same-sex attraction as indicating a trans identity. In an article last year in BJPsych Bulletin, a medical journal, Lucy Griffin, a consultant psychiatrist in Bristol, and co-authors found that, of the girls referred to GIDS in one calendar year, only 8.5% were primarily attracted to boys.\n\nCollateral damage\nOnce such children reach 16, gender clinics will prescribe synthetic hormones. Such drugs were used to \u201cchemically castrate\u201d Alan Turing, Dr Griffin points out. The gay mathematician, whose code-breaking helped defeat the Nazis, accepted the drugs as an alternative to a prison sentence. \u201cThe whole thing\u201d, says Dr Griffin, \u201crisks becoming an exercise in damaging the people they are setting out to protect.\u201d \n\nThis article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline \"Missing the mark\"",
    "\nThe definition of the word \u201cmartyr\u201d is debatable and different depending on different cultural and national settings. In the Chinese context, the common usage of the word \u201cmartyr\u201d is often associated with the connotation of \u201cDeath.\u201d In Baidu Baike, a Chinese search engine, martyrs are defined as those who sacrifice their lives during a revolution, a war to protect their nation, the establishment of socialism or a fight for the rights of the majority . To highlight such dignified usage of \u201cmartyrs\u201d, China even started to issue Martyr Laws in 2018 in a bid to protect the reputation of the martyrs or to defend its own political and cultural ideals. It is clearly stated in the document that the law is formulated to maintain the public well-being of society, to promote nationalism and to cultivate the core value of socialism. Known as a non-religious country, China does not offer religion classes in schools; however, in high schools and even primary schools, students are instilled with historical and folk stories about China and more importantly about many Chinese martyrs. The lack of religions contributes to the use of martyrdom as a medium to unite the people in a nation. In this modern world, people are still converted, not to Buddhism or Christianity but to nationalism. Nationalism is not a bad thing in itself, but it is interesting to discover what the nationalistic indoctrination has brought to the citizens and the world. The specific objectives of this paper are to explain the intention behind the indoctrination of heroism and martyrdom with the illustrations of some well-known Chinese martyrs\u2019 stories, and to relate the political usage of martyrdom to other countries since China is not alone on the path of nationalism. In the end, the paper will discuss how politics is a new form of religion and martyrdom is merely one of the media to preach such religion.  ",
    "Members of Parliament, Ministers, Ambassadors, honoured guests; I would like to start by thanking the honourable member Hilde Vautmans for her kind introduction.\n\nI must say it is an enormous privilege to be speaking as Patron of the UK's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and amongst a collective of policy makers and legislators from around the world, not only focused on the interests of children, but resolute in protecting their fundamental rights.\n\nFor over 130 years, the NSPCC has fought tirelessly for every childhood, and its charitable mission - 'to ensure every child is safe from abuse' is as critically important today as when the Reverend Benjamin Waugh founded the charity in 1884.\n\nToday\u2019s internet-age presents us all with enormous and positive opportunities to engage with each other online in ways we have never been able to do before. However, this virtual opening also presents new and very dangerous threats to our children, including the way that the internet enables predators to commit truly horrific abuse within what should be the sanctity and safety of a child's own home. This abuse has devastating consequences and severe long-term repercussions on their mental health, family and future relationships, with many experiencing trauma and long- term behavioral problems, and all too many attempting and committing suicide.\n\n\u2018Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation\u2019 affects every country in the world and requires the strength and tenacity of us all to combat it, especially when across Europe, one in five internet users are children. Additionally, it is no one person's or organisation's responsibility, it is all our responsibilities to seek ways to prevent these crimes being committed, and so....\n\nToday I ask you to rededicate your efforts to ensure that the internet is a place of safety for all.\n\nAs a reminder of why we are here today and what our mission is I would like to share a couple of accounts of young people, who have been supported by the NSPCC but whose traumatic experiences are replicated across Europe and beyond.\n\nTheir names have been changed to protect their privacy, but their voices must be heard; and their stories along with the tens of thousands of others must be the driving force and inspiration for your policies and laws. Above all, we must never lose sight of the devastation that too many children have experienced.\n\nAt the age of 14, Ben began speaking on Facebook to someone he thought was a girl, but was in fact a man who threatened to kill Ben\u2019s parents if he didn't send some explicit photos of himself. Ben was terrified as this individual knew so many details about his family, so he did as he was asked. The scale of demands increased as did the threats to send the photos to Ben's friends. This person then shared the pictures and videos with other men along with Ben\u2019s telephone number and details, who contacted him for more images which Ben supplied.\n\nEventually, not knowing how to stop it and feeling desperate Ben tried to take his own life. Discovered by his mother he was taken to hospital. Subsequently the police became involved and Ben had to tell his family what had happened. He says \"I couldn't leave the house for ages and still feel sick when I go outside, but that just feels normal now. It feels normal to always feel like I'm going to be sick.\u201d\n\nBen\u2019s experience is not at all unique. In the year ending March 2021 there were over 90,000 child sexual abuse and image offences recorded by the police in the UK, and around 200,000 children have sent, received or been asked to send sexual content to an adult.\n\nLast year the Internet Watch Foundation reported that in the UK alone there were 8.8 million attempts to access images and videos of children sufferiing sexual abuse during the country's lockdown, and this year reported a 117 percent increase in self-generated images in the first four months of 2021.\n\nBut these figures are not just limited to the UK ... 65% of children in Western Europe surveyed by the Weprotect Global Alliance have experienced at least one instance of online sexual harm. 65 per cent. That is well over half of our children who have been targeted and affected by these crimes.\n\nIf they faced this level of risk every time they stepped outside into the physical world, I ask you, would we allow that to go unchallenged?\n\nFrida was only 13 when she was groomed by a married man in his 30s. It all started through Facebook before moving to WhatsApp and he appealed to her vulnerabilities surrounding her self- esteem and the fact she was being bullied at school to persuade her that they were in love and to trust him. Over a number of years he manipulated her into sharing explicit photos of herself, he also sent her images of himself.\n\nHer experiences left her with long-term depression and anxiety, and at times Frida felt suicidal. By the age of 18, still involved with this man online, she was self-harming and had unhealthy coping mechanisms. Although she has been having therapy to help her deal with her issues, she has never revealed to her therapist what has really been happening as she was ashamed and terrified of being in trouble for making explicit images of herself when underage. Frida says: \"I still feel very conflicted about it because I knew at the time it was wrong but still kept doing it. I know I was a child and he was responsible as the adult, but it\u2019s still hard for me to view it as exploitation. This online relationship had serious consequences on my mental health.\"\n\nThese stories are just two examples of the realities behind the screens - how these devious and manipulative criminals can easily gain access into young lives and devastate them. There are countless calls made on a daily basis to NSPCC's Childline, and today, I visited Belgium\u2019s Child Focus where, just as elsewhere in the world, I saw persistent evidence that young people are being abused and are suffering unimaginable mental anguish and terror online.\n\nThe distressing reality is that as COVID-19 made us ever-more reliant on virtual means to communicate; it also gave greater rise to Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. During lockdowns, at home, in their bedrooms, or when going online to stay connected with family and friends, children were exposed to horrendous, but preventable harm. Abusers look to exploit ever younger children, meeting them on social networks, grooming them through direct messages, coercing them into sending self-generated images, and escalating their abuse on encrypted messaging and livestreaming sites.\n\nAccording to the WeProtect Global Alliance\u2019s Global-Threat-Assessment this year, that harm in some of our countries in Europe has gone up 50%!\n\nI am profoundly sorry to say that we are simply not protecting or preparing our children to use this transnational and virtual space.\n\nBut, let us recognise that this is a challenge we can solve and we can and must look to give children the safe and happy environment they deserve.\n\nFirst, while it is important that we balance the fundamental rights of all Internet users, particularly around privacy, we must not do this at the cost of children\u2019s rights.\n\nBecause when a child is coerced into creating an image or video, their basic human rights have been compromised and their privacy is stolen from them. We must also remember that every single time that an image or video is played, with every click they are re-victimised. And while the privacy of the criminal remains protected, this cycle of re-victimisation can persist indefinitely.\n\nSecondly, we owe it to our children that they can freely and safely use online services that are fundamentally safe-by-design and we should expect that when companies are designing their products, or roll out new features, they must consider the risks to our children.\n\nLet us encourage innovation to identify child abuse on messaging services. Let us tackle the growing problem of online grooming with novel technologies. Firms should take every reasonable step to \u201cdesign out\u201d harm and detect and report abuse and children should be front of mind during this process, and never an afterthought.\n\nThirdly, civil society organizations play a key role in highlighting where we need to go further and in highlighting the gaps between what companies say they are doing and the lived experience of children who may have an altogether different story. I applaud the efforts of a number of international groups who are working to find solutions including WeProtect Global Alliance, the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, and more recently the Technology Coalition whose willing collaboration in this fight is absolutely critical to its success.\n\nIn the months ahead I know policy makers and legislators around the world, will hope to strike that balance in upholding the rights of internet users while protecting the rights of children; but let that balance rest on the very real human suffering that presently exists across all our countries.\n\nThis audience present here in Brussels, and online around the world, will have a pivotal role in ensuring the protection of our children, and I stand with you all in being unwavering in our commitment to strengthen regimes in order to protect children from harms.\n\nAnd while we are focusing on the preventative measures that will not allow these crimes to be committed, we must also continue to work together to disrupt and detect harm. Child Focus here in Belgium communicates across Europe to share and inform national responses to unfolding crimes, and is just one example of how important international collaboration is. No one nation can claim to have all the answers, but every nation has a part to play in sharing solutions, exchanging best practices and co-operating on the international response to this most heinous of threats to our children.\n\nToday, I hope we are one step further along the road in making the world - both virtual and physical - a safe place for all our children and the children of the future. I thank you for listening to me, but more particularly I thank you for the time you dedicate to solving this imperative issue.\n",

Before I am much older I hope I shall come to know many of them.\n\nAlthough there is none of my father's subjects from the oldest to the youngest whom I do not wish to greet, I am thinking especially today of all the young men and women who were born about the same time as myself and have grown up like me in terrible and glorious years of the second world war.\n\nWill you, the youth of the British family of nations, let me speak on my birthday as your representative? Now that we are coming to manhood and womanhood it is surely a great joy to us all to think that we shall be able to take some of the burden off the shoulders of our elders who have fought and worked and suffered to protect our childhood.\n\nWe must not be daunted by the anxieties and hardships that the war has left behind for every nation of our commonwealth. We know that these things are the price we cheerfully undertook to pay for the high honour of standing alone, seven years ago, in defence of the liberty of the world. Let us say with Rupert Brooke: \"Now God be thanked who has matched us with this hour\".\n\nI am sure that you will see our difficulties, in the light that I see them, as the great opportunity for you and me. Most of you have read in the history books the proud saying of William Pitt that England had saved herself by her exertions and would save Europe by her example. But in our time we may say that the British Empire has saved the world first, and has now to save itself after the battle is won.\n\nI think that is an even finer thing than was done in the days of Pitt; and it is for us, who have grown up in these years of danger and glory, to see that it is accomplished in the long years of peace that we all hope stretch ahead.\n\nIf we all go forward together with an unwavering faith, a high courage, and a quiet heart, we shall be able to make of this ancient commonwealth, which we all love so dearly, an even grander thing - more free, more prosperous, more happy and a more powerful influence for good in the world - than it has been in the greatest days of our forefathers.\n\nTo accomplish that we must give nothing less than the whole of ourselves. There is a motto which has been borne by many of my ancestors - a noble motto, \"I serve\". Those words were an inspiration to many bygone heirs to the Throne when they made their knightly dedication as they came to manhood. I cannot do quite as they did.\n\nBut through the inventions of science I can do what was not possible for any of them. I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening. I should like to make that dedication now. It is very simple.\n\nI declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\n\nBut I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.",
    "THE PRESIDENT:  Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, members of Congress, distinguished guests, but most importantly, Elizabeth and Robin \u2014 I know this is not easy.  Thank you for letting us do this.\n \nWe meet here in the very heart of American democracy, the Capitol of the United States of America, to receive a hero of that democracy for a final time: Robert Joseph Dole.  He belongs here, in this place, in this temple of liberty \u2014 to liberty and to \u2014 temple to possibilities.\n \nBob Dole loved this Capitol.  It\u2019s where he served the nation, shaped by the figures that surround us: Washington and Jefferson, who set us on our path; Abraham Lincoln, another man who \u2014 from the Heartland of the country from whence he came; Bob\u2019s hero, Dwight David Eisenhower; Martin Luther King, Jr., whom Bob helped pass legislation honoring the great civil rights leader with a federal holiday \u2014 Bob stood up and got that done; Gerald Ford, who served here and with whom Bob sought the vice presidency of the United States.\n \nIn a sentence: Bob belongs here.  He too was a giant of our history \u2014 and that\u2019s not hyperbole; it\u2019s real \u2014 of wit and grace, of principle and persistence, of courage and conviction.\n \nI had the great honor of serving with Bob, as many of you around this casket have.  I served with him for 25 years. \n\nHe did have great wit.  They once asked him why in God\u2019s name did he vote to continue to fund Amtrak.  He said because if he didn\u2019t, \u201cBiden would stay overnight and cause more trouble.\u201d  (Laughter.)  I commuted every day.  (Laughs.)  It\u2019s a true story.  He was the deciding vote.\n\nWell, you know, Bob and I \u2014 like many of us here \u2014 we disagreed on a number of things but not on any of the fundamental things.  We still found a way to work together.\n\nWe genuinely \u2014 we genuinely respected one another as colleagues and as fellow Americans.  It was real; it wasn\u2019t fake.  And we became great friends.\n \nAnd because Bob deserves the final word, I\u2019d like to read a portion of his final message that he left to the country that I hope we all listen to in the days and weeks and months to come. \n \nAnd I quote Bob Dole:\n \n\u201cI cannot pretend that I have not been a loyal champion [of] my party, but [I\u2019ve] always served my country best when I did [it] so first and foremost as an American.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhen we prioritize principles over party and humanity over personal legacy\u201d \u2014 when we do that, we \u201caccomplish far more as a nation.  By leading with shared faith in each other, we become America at its best.\u201d  He went on to say, \u201ca beacon of hope, a source of comfort in crisis, a shield against those who threaten freedom.\u201d \n \n\u201cOur nation has certainly faced periods of division.  But at the end of the day, we have always found ways to come together.  We can find that unity again.\u201d\n \nAnd then the message said, end of message.\n \nMy fellow Americans, America has lost one of our greatest patriots.  We may follow his wisdom, I hope, and his timeless truth.  But the truth of the matter is: As divided as we are, the only way forward for democracy is unity, consensus \u2014 the only way.  May we follow his wisdom and his timeless truth and reach consensus on the basic fundamental principles we all agree on.   \n \nMay God bless Bob Dole.  May God bless America.  And may God protect our troops.",
    "Cross country skiing star eyes Beijing 2022 medal\n\nSaying goodbye is never easy.\n\nBut getting to bid your final farewell to a sport you have been very successful in for over 15 years on your terms \u2013 as Switzerland\u2019s cross-country skiing maestro Dario Cologna did in November 2021 - goes some way to making a bit better:\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any easier to stay at the top,\u201d the 35-year-old said frankly to Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung explaining his intention to end his athletic career. \u201cI had no reason to delay my resignation.\u201d\n\nCologna\u2019s retirement announcement ahead of this year\u2019s cross-country season stems from the three-time Olympian\u2019s desire to be the master of his own destiny. With a \u201cclear\u201d head following the news, he can now get to task.\n\nThough the shining light of Swiss Ski may be in his twilight years, his ambitions have not waned. The new father-of-one has his sights set on an eye-watering fifth gold medal at Beijing 2022.\n\nLongevity and success in sport is a formula very few athletes in the history of sport have cracked. Taking a page out of the rulebook written by his fellow compatriot tennis legend Roger Federer, Cologna now understands it\u2019s about picking his battles. Gone are the days where he keeps pace in the sprint finishes week-in-week-out with young guns Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo and Alexander Bolshunov; like the spider in its web, he will instead bide his time.\n\nNo one knows better than Cologna what he is capable of. After he stunned his critics at the top of the year with a second-place finish at the Tour de Ski in Val M\u00fcstair over the 15km classic Cologna sharply reminded his opponents:\u201c As a four-time Olympic champion, I know what to do.\u201d\n\n\nMen's Skiathlon 15 km Classic + 15 km Free - Cologna Wins Gold\nDario Cologna: Launching an \u201cattack\u201d on Olympic medal number five\nHow does a cross-country skier maintain a 100 percent gold medal win rate across four Winter Olympic Games?\n\nAn iron resolve, like the one Cologna\u2019s has already flashed in setting himself the target of a fifth top place finishing at Beijing 2022, certainly helps, but even he knows alone it won\u2019t suffice.\n\nTo keep pace over the years, the former world champion from 2013 has always committed to innovation, and in several ways.\n\nEarlier this year, the Swiss announced for the first time in his career that he would be changing up his ski equipment and switching his supplier.\n\nHis new skis, which are tapered, resemble much more alpine skis than regular cross-country skis. The decision to experiment away from what the rest of the field is using is grounded in a consideration for the conditions in Beijing, China. To \u201cattack there again\u201d, Cologna believes his shortened skis will be optimal in the colder climate.\n\nIt may be a big gamble but historically, the four-time World Cup winner has always thrived off change.\n\nIn addition to switching gyms to one far from his home in search of inspiration, the Swiss skier is also now on the fifth coach of his career - Kein Einstate. Though such changeovers might be destabilising for some, Cologna's rotating his training staff has never been a consequence of a lack of success. The impetus has always been about pushing his limits so that he can to stay ahead:\n\n\"I wanted to introduce new stimuli to my training,\" Cologna said of the appointment in November 2020 to Datasport. \"You can't reinvent everything, but there are new forms of training, including intervals and strength, which are noticeable to me as an athlete.\"\n\nDario Cologna: first-time father mulls the future\nOff the mountain tracks there is also another why Cologna\u2019s motivation for a medal in Beijing 2022 runs particularly deep.\n\nIn October the reigning Olympic champion announced to the world the arrival of his first son, Leano with his wife Laura, and his new role as a father has shifted his perspective.\n\nLife with his new-born has opened the athlete\u2019s eyes to life after cross-country skiing, and while he knows that means relinquishing his iron grip on the sport for good, nothing and no one will stop him from throwing everything at his final hurrah.\n\n\"I am convinced,\" Cologna continued to Datasport, \"if I reach my top form and everything fits together on day X, I can still win medals.\"",
    "Court won't stop Texas abortion ban, but lets clinics sue\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday left in place Texas\u2019 ban on most abortions, offering only a glimmer of daylight for clinics in the state to challenge the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion law.\n\nThe decision, little more than a week after the court signaled it would roll back abortion rights and possibly overturn its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, was greeted with dismay by abortion rights supporters but praise by opponents.\n\nFive conservative justices, including three appointed by former President Donald Trump, formed a majority to limit who can be sued by the clinics, a result that both sides said probably will prevent federal courts from effectively blocking the law.\n\nTexas licensing officials may be sued, but not state court judges, court clerks or state Attorney General Ken Paxton, the court ruled. That seems to leave people free, under the unusual structure of the Texas law, to sue abortion clinics and anyone else who \u201caids or abets\u201d an abortion performed after cardiac activity is detected in an embryo, around six weeks and before some women know they're pregnant.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has essentially greenlit Texas\u2019s cynical scheme and prevented federal courts from blocking an unconstitutional law,\" the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the Texas clinics, said on Twitter.\n\nThe court acted more than a month after hearing arguments over the law, which makes no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThe law has been in place for about three months, since Sept. 1. The Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide has stood since 1973.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, who has consistently voted against abortion rights, did not mention Roe in his main opinion for the court Friday. Gorsuch is one of the Trump appointees, along with Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nAbortion providers will now attempt to run the same legal gantlet that has previously frustrated them. The federal judge who already has once blocked the law, known as S.B. 8, almost certainly will be asked to do so again. Then his decision would be reviewed by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has twice voted to allow enforcement of the abortion ban.",
    "Truck crash kills 55 migrants, injures dozens more in southern Mexico\n\nFifty-five mostly Central Americans were killed on Thursday when the truck they were in flipped over in southern Mexico, in one of the worst accidents involving migrants who risk their lives to reach the United States.\n\nThe trailer broke open, spilling out people, when the truck crashed on a sharp curve outside the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in the state of Chiapas, according to video footage of the aftermath and civil protection authorities.\n\nRutilio Escandon, the state's governor, said 49 people died at the scene, and five more while receiving medical attention. On Friday, he said another person had been pronounced dead.\n\n\"Unfortunately one more person died,\" Escandon said in a tweet, as he offered words of support to survivors and victims' families.\n\n\"In conjunction with the Federal Government, we guarantee that the injured and the families of the deceased are not alone,\" he said. \"I have instructed that we provide necessary care, we will spare no effort.\"\n\nIn footage broadcast on social media, a shocked Guatemalan man sitting at the scene said, \u201cIt took a bend, and because of the weight of us people inside, we all went with it.\"\n\nHe added, \u201cthe trailer couldn\u2019t handle the weight of people.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 people were inside the trailer, authorities said. Several dozen were injured and taken to hospitals in Chiapas, which borders Guatemala. Dozens of Guatemalan migrants were named in lists of the injured published on social media.\n\nA Reuters witness heard cries and sobs among survivors as emergency personnel rushed to the site of where the overturned truck shuddered to a halt by a highway footbridge.\n\nReuters images showed a white trailer on its side, with injured people splayed out on tarps on the ground. There were also rows of what appeared to be bodies wrapped in white cloth.\n\nA video of the scene streamed on social media showed a woman holding a child wailing in her lap, both covered in blood. Another video showed a man curled up in pain inside the destroyed trailer, hardly moving as helpers pulled out bodies.\n\nMen, women and children were among the dead, the Chiapas state government said, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Twitter expressed his sorrow at the \u201cvery painful\u201d incident.\n\n\nMigrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America typically trek through Mexico to reach the U.S. border, and sometimes cram into large trucks organized by smugglers in extremely dangerous conditions.\n\n\u201cThis shows us that irregular migration is not the best way,\u201d Kevin Lopez, a spokesman for Guatemala\u2019s presidency, told Milenio television after the accident.\n\nHe did not know how many Guatemalan victims there were.\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s foreign minister, Alexandra Hill, said her government was working to see if Salvadorans had died.\n\nMexico offered lodging and humanitarian visas to the survivors, and Chiapas Governor Escandon said those responsible for the accident would be held to account.\n\nOfficials in Mexico routinely come across migrants packed into trailers, including 600 people found hidden in the back of two trucks in eastern Mexico last month.\n\nThe journey north from Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala is perilous and expensive, and many migrants fall prey to criminal gangs en route. In January, 19 people, mostly migrants, were massacred with suspected police involvement in northern Mexico.\n\nRecord numbers of people have been arrested on the U.S.-Mexico border this year as migrants seek to capitalize on President Joe Biden\u2019s pledge to pursue more humane immigration policies than his hardline predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nMexican authorities in Chiapas have attempted to persuade migrants to not form caravans to walk thousands of miles to the U.S. border, and have begun transporting people from the southern city of Tapachula to other regions of the country.\n\nThe Biden administration has also urged migrants not to leave their homelands for the United States, and this week saw the restart of a policy initiated under Trump to send asylum seekers back to Mexico to await their court hearings.\n\nSome critics argue that tougher policies push migrants into the hands of the human smugglers, putting their lives at risk.\n\n\u201c(Authorities) generate smuggled migration that generates billions of dollars in profits,\u201d said migrant activist Ruben Figueroa.",
    "whether there's afterlife, the answer has never been the same. the atheists deny after life, believing that our life is no more than from the cradle to the grave. they may care about their illustrious names after death; they may feel attached to the affection of their offspring, but they never lay their hopes on their afterlife. they may also say that good will be rewarded with good, and evil with evil, but they don't really believe any retribution in their after life.\n\nhowever, in the religious world or among the superstitious people, the belief in afterlife is very popular. they do not only believe in afterlife, but thousands of reincarnations as well. in the mysterious world, there are the paradise and the hell, the celestial beings and the gods, the buddha and the bodhisattvas.\n\nmaybe they really believed it, or maybe they just wanted to make use of people's veneration, the ancient emperors always declared that they were the real dragons, the sons of god, while the royal ministers claimed to be the reincarnations of various constellations. but can the stars reincarnate?\n\nmany people burn incense and kowtow, do good deeds and strive for virtues, not just for the present, but mainly to let god see their sincerity so as to be reborn into a better afterlife, or to achieve the highest enlightenment after several lives of practice. they do believe in afterlife. but i can't help asking: suppose there were no afterlife, would you still do good deeds and strive for virtues? and if god does not see what you are doing, would you still be so upright and selfless? if you work, not for serving the public and liberating the others, but just for a better afterlife of your own, isn't it a little too selfish? comparing with this kind of believers, those who don't believe in afterlife, but still keep doing good deeds, are the most sincere and honest philanthropists, because they do them not for themselves but for other.",
    "It is undeniable that the worsening environment has become the biggest concern of the present-day world. Land resources are dwindling because of water loss and soil erosion. Waste gases poison the air we breathe. The rivers and lakes are polluted by waste dumped in them from factories. It is probably no exaggeration to say that deterioration of the quality of the environment threatens the existence of mankind itself.\n\nSome people are of the opinion that the environmental problem is the price we have to pay for economic development. But I do not think that this argument is valid. After all, what is the point of economic growth if people's lives are adversely alfected by worsening environmental pollution?\n\nThere is plenty of evidence to show that sustainable development can be achieved by balancing economic growth with protection of the environment. The key to achieving this is to make people aware of the seriousness of the problem. Both governments and ordinary citizens should join hands to make this world a better place to live in, not only for ourselves, but also for future generations.",
    "I have just chaired a meeting of the Cabinet, where we agreed that the Government should call a general election, to be held on June 8.\n\nI want to explain the reasons for that decision, what will happen next and the choice facing the British people when you come to vote in this election.\n\nLast summer, after the country voted to leave the European Union, Britain needed certainty, stability and strong leadership, and since I became Prime Minister the Government has delivered precisely that.\n\nDespite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, since the referendum we have seen consumer confidence remain high, record numbers of jobs, and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations.\n\nWe have also delivered on the mandate that we were handed by the referendum result.\n\nBritain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back. And as we look to the future, the Government has the right plan for negotiating our new relationship with Europe.\n\nWe want a deep and special partnership between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is free to chart its own way in the world.\n\nThat means we will regain control of our own money, our own laws and our own borders and we will be free to strike trade deals with old friends and new partners all around the world.\n\nThis is the right approach, and it is in the national interest. But the other political parties oppose it.\n\nAt this moment of enormous national significance there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division.\n\nThe country is coming together, but Westminster is not.\n\nIn recent weeks Labour has threatened to vote against the deal we reach with the European Union.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standsill.\n\nThe Scottish National Party say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals Britain's membership of the European Union.\n\nAnd unelected members of the House of Lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way.\n\nOur opponents believe that because the Government's majority is so small, our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course.\n\nThey are wrong.\n\nThey under-estimate our determination to get the job done and I am not prepared to let them endanger the security of millions of working people across the country.\n\nBecause what they are doing jeopardises the work we must do to prepare for Brexit at home and it weakens the Government's negotiating position in Europe.\n\nIf we do not hold a general election now their political game-playing will continue, and the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election.\n\nDivision in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country.\n\nSo we need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin.\n\nI have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion.\n\nSince I became Prime Minister I have said that there should be no election until 2020, but now I have concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take.\n\nAnd so tomorrow I will move a motion in the House of Commons calling for a general election to be held on the eighth of June.\n\nThat motion, as set out by the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, will require a two-thirds majority of the House of Commons.\n\nSo I have a simple challenge to the opposition parties, you have criticised the Government's vision for Brexit, you have challenged our objectives, you have threatened to block the legislation we put before Parliament.\n\nThis is your moment to show you mean it, to show you are not opposing the Government for the sake of it, to show that you do not treat politics as a game.\n\nLet us tomorrow vote for an election, let us put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programmes for government and then let the people decide.\n\nAnd the decision facing the country will be all about leadership. It will be a choice between strong and stable leadership in the national interest, with me as your Prime Minister, or weak and unstable coalition government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, propped up by the Liberal Democrats - who want to reopen the divisions of the referendum - and Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP.\n\nEvery vote for the Conservatives will make it harder for opposition politicians who want to stop me from getting the job done.\n\nEvery vote for the Conservatives will make me stronger when I negotiate for Britain with the prime ministers, presidents and chancellors of the European Union.\n\nEvery vote for the Conservatives means we can stick to our plan for a stronger Britain and take the right long-term decisions for a more secure future.\n\nIt was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond.\n\nSo, tomorrow, let the House of Commons vote for an election, let everybody put forward their proposals for Brexit and their programmes for Government, and let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability and continue to give the country the strong and stable leadership it demands.",
    "The associative machinery seeks causes. The difficulty we have with statistical regularities is that they call for a different approach. Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be what it is\u2014chance selected it from among its alternatives. Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to serious mistakes in evaluating the randomness of truly random events. For an example, take the sex of six babies born in sequence at a hospital. The sequence of boys and girls is obviously random; the events are independent of each other, and the number of boys and girls who were born in the hospital in the last few hours has no effect whatsoever on the sex of the next baby. Now consider three possible sequences: BBBGGG GGGGGG BGBBGB Are the sequences equally likely? The intuitive answer\u2014\u201cof course not!\u201d\u2014 is false. Because the events are independent and because the outcomes B and G are (approximately) equally likely, then any possible sequence of six births is as likely as any other. Even now that you know this conclusion is true, it remains counterintuitive, because only the third sequence appears random. As expected, BGBBGB is judged much more likely than the other two sequences. We are pattern seekers, believers in a coherent world, in which regularities (such as a sequence of six girls) appear not by accident but as a result of mechanical causality or of someone\u2019s intention. We do not expect to see regularity produced by a random process, and when we detect what appears to be a rule, we quickly reject the idea that the process is truly random. Random processes produce many sequences that convince people that the process is not random after all. You can see why assuming causality could have had evolutionary advantages. It is part of the general vigilance that we have inherited from ancestors. We are automatically on the lookout for the possibility that the environment has changed. Lions may appear on the plain at random times, but it would be safer to notice and respond to an apparent increase in the rate of appearance of prides of lions, even if it is actually due to the fluctuations of a random process. The widespread misunderstanding of randomness sometimes has significant consequences. In our article on representativeness, Amos and I cited the statistician William Feller, who illustrated the ease with which people see patterns where none exists. During the intensive rocket bombing of London in World War II, it was generally believed that the bombing could not be random because a map of the hits revealed conspicuous gaps. Some suspected that German spies were located in the unharmed areas. A careful statistical analysis revealed that the distribution of hits was typical of a random process\u2014and typical as well in evoking a strong impression that it was not random. \u201cTo the untrained eye,\u201d Feller remarks, \u201crandomness appears as regularity or tendency to cluster.\u201d I soon had an occasion to apply what I had learned frpea\u0440rainom Feller. The Yom Kippur War broke out in 1973, and my only significant contribution to the war effort was to advise high officers in the Israeli Air Force to stop an investigation. The air war initially went quite badly for Israel, because of the unexpectedly good performance of Egyptian groundto-air missiles. Losses were high, and they appeared to be unevenly distributed. I was told of two squadrons flying from the same base, one of which had lost four planes while the other had lost none. An inquiry was initiated in the hope of learning what it was that the unfortunate squadron was doing wrong. There was no prior reason to believe that one of the squadrons was more effective than the other, and no operational differences were found, but of course the lives of the pilots differed in many random ways, including, as I recall, how often they went home between missions and something about the conduct of debriefings. My advice was that the command should accept that the different outcomes were due to blind luck, and that the interviewing of the pilots should stop. I reasoned that luck was the most likely answer, that a random search for a nonobvious cause was hopeless, and that in the meantime the pilots in the squadron that had sustained losses did not need the extra burden of being made to feel that they and their dead friends were at fault. Some years later, Amos and his students Tom Gilovich and Robert Vallone caused a stir with their study of misperceptions of randomness in basketball. The \u201cfact\u201d that players occasionally acquire a hot hand is generally accepted by players, coaches, and fans. The inference is irresistible: a player sinks three or four baskets in a row and you cannot help forming the causal judgment that this player is now hot, with a temporarily increased propensity to score. Players on both teams adapt to this judgment\u2014teammates are more likely to pass to the hot scorer and the defense is more likely to doubleteam. Analysis of thousands of sequences of shots led to a disappointing conclusion: there is no such thing as a hot hand in professional basketball, either in shooting from the field or scoring from the foul line. Of course, some players are more accurate than others, but the sequence of successes and missed shots satisfies all tests of randomness. The hot hand is entirely in the eye of the beholders, who are consistently too quick to perceive order and causality in randomness. The hot hand is a massive and widespread cognitive illusion. The public reaction to this research is part of the story. The finding was picked up by the press because of its surprising conclusion, and the general response was disbelief. When the celebrated coach of the Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach, heard of Gilovich and his study, he responded, \u201cWho is this guy? So he makes a study. I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d The tendency to see patterns in randomness is overwhelming\u2014certainly more impressive than a guy making a study. The illusion of pattern affects our lives in many ways off the basketball court. How many good years should you wait before concluding that an investment adviser is unusually skilled? How many successful acquisitions should be needed for a board of directors to believe that the CEO has extraordinary flair for such deals? The simple answer to these questions is that if you follow your intuition, you will more often than not err by misclassifying a random event as systematic. We are far too willing to reject the belief that much of what we see in life is random. I began this chapter with the example of cancer incidence across the United States. The example appears in a book intended for statistics teachers, but I learned about it from an amusing article by the two statisticians I quoted earlier, Howard Wainer and Harris Zwerling. Their essay focused on a large iive\u0440othersnvestment, some $1.7 billion, which the Gates Foundation made to follow up intriguing findings on the characteristics of the most successful schools. Many researchers have sought the secret of successful education by identifying the most successful schools in the hope of discovering what distinguishes them from others. One of the conclusions of this research is that the most successful schools, on average, are small. In a survey of 1,662 schools in Pennsylvania, for instance, 6 of the top 50 were small, which is an overrepresentation by a factor of 4. These data encouraged the Gates Foundation to make a substantial investment in the creation of small schools, sometimes by splitting large schools into smaller units. At least half a dozen other prominent institutions, such as the Annenberg Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trust, joined the effort, as did the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Smaller Learning Communities Program. This probably makes intuitive sense to you. It is easy to construct a causal story that explains how small schools are able to provide superior education and thus produce high-achieving scholars by giving them more personal attention and encouragement than they could get in larger schools. Unfortunately, the causal analysis is pointless because the facts are wrong. If the statisticians who reported to the Gates Foundation had asked about the characteristics of the worst schools, they would have found that bad schools also tend to be smaller than average. The truth is that small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable. If anything, say Wainer and Zwerling, large schools tend to produce better results, especially in higher grades where a variety of curricular options is valuable. Thanks to recent advances in cognitive psychology, we can now see clearly what Amos and I could only glimpse: the law of small",
    "My collaboration with Amos in the early 1970s began with a discussion of the claim that people who have had no training in statistics are good \u201cintuitive statisticians.\u201d He told my seminar and me of researchers at the University of Michigan who were generally optimistic about intuitive statistics. I had strong feelings about that claim, which I took personally: I had recently discovered that I was not a good intuitive statistician, and I did not believe that I was worse than others. For a research psychologist, sampling variation is not a curiosity; it is a nuisance and a costly obstacle, which turns the undertaking of every research project into a gamble. Suppose that you wish to confirm the hypothesis that the vocabulary of the average six-year-old girl is larger than the vocabulary of an average boy of the same age. The hypothesis is true in the population; the average vocabulary of girls is indeed larger. Girls and boys vary a great deal, however, and by the luck of the draw you could select a sample in which the difference is inconclusive, or even one in which boys actually score higher. If you are the researcher, this outcome is costly to you because you have wasted time and effort, and failed to confirm a hypothesis that was in fact true. Using a sufficiently large sample is the only way to reduce the risk. Researchers who pick too small a sample leave themselves at the mercy of sampling luck. The risk of error can be estimated for any given sample size by a fairly simple procedure. Traditionally, however, psychologists do not use calculations to decide on a sample size. They use their judgment, which is commonly flawed. An article I had read shortly before the debate with Amos demonstrated the mistake that researchers made (they still do) by a dramatic observation. The author pointed out that psychologists commonly chose samples so small that they exposed themselves to a 50% risk of failing to confirm their true hypotheses! No researcher in his right mind would accept such a risk. A plausible explanation was that psychologists\u2019 decisions about sample size reflected prevalent intuitive misconceptions of the extent of sampling variation. The article shocked me, because it explained some troubles I had had in my own research. Like most research psychologists, I had routinely chosen samples that were too small and had often obtained results that made no sense. Now I knew why: the odd results were actually artifacts of my research method. My mistake was particularly embarrassing because I taught statistics and knew how to compute the sample size that would reduce the risk of failure to an acceptable level. But I had never chosen a sample size by computation. Like my colleagues, I had trusted tradition and my intuition in planning my experiments and had never thought seriously about the issue. When Amos visited the seminar, I had already reached the conclusion that my intuitions were deficient, and in the course of the seminar we quickly agreed that the Michigan optimists were wrong. Amos and I set out to examine whether I was the only fool or a member of a majority of fools, by testing whether researchers selected for mathematical expertise would make similar mistakes. We developed a questionnaire that described realistic research situations, including replications of successful experiments. It asked the researchers to choose sample sizes, to assess the risks of failure to which their decisions exposed them, and to provide advice to hypothetical graduate students planning their research. Amos collected the responses of a group of sophisticated participants (including authors of two statistical textbooks) at a meetati\u0440p> Amos and I called our first joint article \u201cBelief in the Law of Small Numbers.\u201d We explained, tongue-in-cheek, that \u201cintuitions about random sampling appear to satisfy the law of small numbers, which asserts that the law of large numbers applies to small numbers as well.\u201d We also included a strongly worded recommendation that researchers regard their \u201cstatistical intuitions with proper suspicion and replace impression formation by computation whenever possible.",
    "Paul Slovic probably knows more about the peculiarities of human\njudgment of risk than any other individual. His work offers a picture of Mr.\nand Ms. Citizen that is far from flattering: guided by emotion rather than by\nreason, easily swayed by trivial details, and inadequately sensitive to\ndifferences between low and negligibly low probabilities. Slovic has also\nstudied experts, who are clearly superior in dealing with numbers and\namounts. Experts show many of the same biases as the rest of us in\nattenuated form, but often their judgments and preferences about risks\ndiverge from those of other people. Differences between experts and the public are explained in part by\nbiases in lay judgments, but Slovic draws attention to situations in which\nthe differences reflect a genuine conflict of values. He points out that\nexperts often measure risks by the number of lives (or life-years) lost, while\nthe public draws finer distinctions, for example between \u201cgood deaths\u201d and\n\u201cbad deaths,\u201d or between random accidental fatalities and deaths that\noccur in the course of voluntary activities such as skiing. These legitimate\ndistinctions are often ignored in statistics that merely count cases. Slovic\nargues from such observations that the public has a richer conception of\nrisks than the experts do. Consequently, he strongly resists the view that\nthe experts should rule, and that their opinions should be accepted without\nquestion when they conflict with the opinions and wishes of other citizens. When experts and the public disagree on their priorities, he says, \u201cEach\nside muiesst respect the insights and intelligence of the other.\u201d\nIn his desire to wrest sole control of risk policy from experts, Slovic has\nchallenged the foundation of their expertise: the idea that risk is objective.\n\u201cRisk\u201d does not exist \u201cout there,\u201d independent of our minds and\nculture, waiting to be measured. Human beings have invented the\nconcept of \u201crisk\u201d to help them understand and cope with the\ndangers and uncertainties of life. Although these dangers are\nreal, there is no such thing as \u201creal risk\u201d or \u201cobjective risk.\u201d\nTo illustrate his claim, Slovic lists nine ways of defining the mortality risk\nassociated with the release of a toxic material into the air, ranging from\n\u201cdeath per million people\u201d to \u201cdeath per million dollars of product\nproduced.\u201d His point is that the evaluation of the risk depends on the\nchoice of a measure\u2014with the obvious possibility that the choice may\nhave been guided by a preference for one outcome or another. He goes\non to conclude that \u201cdefining risk is thus an exercise in power.\u201d You might\nnot have guessed that one can get to such thorny policy issues from\nexperimental studies of the psychology of judgment! However, policy is\nultimately about people, what they want and what is best for them. Every\npolicy question involves assumptions about human nature, in particular\nabout the choices that people may make and the consequences of their\nchoices for themselves and for society. Another scholar and friend whom I greatly admire, Cass Sunstein,\ndisagrees sharply with Slovic\u2019s stance on the different views of experts and\ncitizens, and defends the role of experts as a bulwark against \u201cpopulist\u201d\nexcesses. Sunstein is one of the foremost legal scholars in the United\nStates, and shares with other leaders of his profession the attribute of\nintellectual fearlessness. He knows he can master any body of knowledge\nquickly and thoroughly, and he has mastered many, including both the\npsychology of judgment and choice and issues of regulation and risk\npolicy. His view is that the existing system of regulation in the United\nStates displays a very poor setting of priorities, which reflects reaction to\npublic pressures more than careful objective analysis. He starts from the\nposition that risk regulation and government intervention to reduce risks\nshould be guided by rational weighting of costs and benefits, and that the\nnatural units for this analysis are the number of lives saved (or perhaps the\nnumber of life-years saved, which gives more weight to saving the young)\nand the dollar cost to the economy. Poor regulation is wasteful of lives and money, both of which can be measured objectively. Sunstein has not been\npersuaded by Slovic\u2019s argument that risk and its measurement is\nsubjective. Many aspects of risk assessment are debatable, but he has\nfaith in the objectivity that may be achieved by science, expertise, and\ncareful deliberation. Sunstein came to believe that biased reactions to risks are an important\nsource of erratic and misplaced priorities in public policy. Lawmakers and\nregulators may be overly responsive to the irrational concerns of citizens,\nboth because of political sensitivity and because they are prone to the\nsame cognitive biases as other citizens. Sunstein and a collaborator, the jurist Timur Kuran, invented a name for\nthe mechanism through which biases flow into policy: the availability\ncascade. They comment that in the social context, \u201call heuristics are equal,\nbut availability is more equal than the others.\u201d They have in mind an expand\nUned notion of the heuristic, in which availability provides a heuristic for\njudgments other than frequency. In particular, the importance of an idea is\noften judged by the fluency (and emotional charge) with which that idea\ncomes to mind. An availability cascade is a self-sustaining chain of events, which may\nstart from media reports of a relatively minor event and lead up to public\npanic and large-scale government action. On some occasions, a media\nstory about a risk catches the attention of a segment of the public, which\nbecomes aroused and worried. This emotional reaction becomes a story\nin itself, prompting additional coverage in the media, which in turn\nproduces greater concern and involvement. The cycle is sometimes sped\nalong deliberately by \u201cavailability entrepreneurs,\u201d individuals or\norganizations who work to ensure a continuous flow of worrying news. The\ndanger is increasingly exaggerated as the media compete for attentiongrabbing headlines. Scientists and others who try to dampen the\nincreasing fear and revulsion attract little attention, most of it hostile:\nanyone who claims that the danger is overstated is suspected of\nassociation with a \u201cheinous cover-up.\u201d The issue becomes politically\nimportant because it is on everyone\u2019s mind, and the response of the\npolitical system is guided by the intensity of public sentiment. The\navailability cascade has now reset priorities. Other risks, and other ways\nthat resources could be applied for the public good, all have faded into the\nbackground. Kuran and Sunstein focused on two examples that are still controversial:\nthe Love Canal affair and the so-called Alar scare. In Love Canal, buried\ntoxic waste was exposed during a rainy season in 1979, causing\ncontamination of the water well beyond standard limits, as well as a foul\nsmell. The residents of the community were angry and frightened, and one\nof them, Lois Gibbs, was particularly active in an attempt to sustain interest\nin the problem. The availability cascade unfolded according to the\nstandard script. At its peak there were daily stories about Love Canal,\nscientists attempting to claim that the dangers were overstated were\nignored or shouted down, ABC News aired a program titled The Killing\nGround, and empty baby-size coffins were paraded in front of the\nlegislature. A large number of residents were relocated at government\nexpense, and the control of toxic waste became the major environmental\nissue of the 1980s. The legislation that mandated the cleanup of toxic\nsites, called CERCLA, established a Superfund and is considered a\nsignificant achievement of environmental legislation. It was also expensive,\nand some have claimed that the same amount of money could have saved many more lives if it had been directed to other priorities. Opinions about what actually happened at Love Canal are still sharply divided, and claims\nof actual damage to health appear not to have been substantiated. Kuran\nand Sunstein wrote up the Love Canal story almost as a pseudo-event, while on the other side of the debate, environmentalists still speak of the\n\u201cLove Canal disaster.\u201d Opinions are also divided on the second example Kuran and Sunstein\nused to illustrate their concept of an availability cascade, the Alar incident,\nknown to detractors of environmental concerns as the \u201cAlar scare\u201d of 1989. Alar is a chemical that was sprayed on apples to regulate their growth and\nimprove their appearance. The scare began with press stories that the\nchemical, when consumed in gigantic doses, caused cancerous tumors in\nrats and mice. The stories understandably frightened the public, and those\nfears encouraged more media coverage, the basic mechanism of an\navailability cascade. The topic dominated the news and produced\ndramatic media events such as the testimony of the actress Meryl Streep\nbefore Congress. The apple industry su ofstained large losses as apples\nand apple products became objects of fear. Kuran and Sunstein quote a\ncitizen who called in to ask \u201cwhether it was safer to pour apple juice down\nthe drain or to take it to a toxic waste dump.\u201d The manufacturer withdrew\nthe product and the FDA banned it. Subsequent research confirmed that\nthe substance might pose a very small risk as a possible carcinogen, but\nthe Alar incident was certainly an enormous overreaction to a minor\nproblem. The net effect of the incident on public health was probably\ndetrimental because fewer good apples were consumed.\nThe Alar tale illustrates a basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight\u2014nothing in between. Every parent who has stayed up waiting for a\nteenage daughter who is late from a party will recognize the feeling. You may know that there is really (almost) nothing to worry about, but you\ncannot help images of disaster from coming to mind. As Slovic has\nargued, the amount of concern is not adequately sensitive to the probability\nof harm; you are imagining the numerator\u2014the tragic story you saw on the\nnews\u2014and not thinking about the denominator. Sunstein has coined the\nphrase \u201cprobability neglect\u201d to describe the pattern. The combination of\nprobability neglect with the social mechanisms of availability cascades\ninevitably leads to gross exaggeration of minor threats, sometimes with\nimportant consequences.\nIn today\u2019s world, terrorists are the most significant practitioners of the art\nof inducing availability cascades. With a few horrible exceptions such as\n9/11, the number of casualties from terror attacks is very small relative to\nother causes of death. Even in countries that have been targets of\nintensive terror campaigns, such as Israel, the weekly number of casualties\nalmost never came close to the number of traffic deaths. The difference is\nin the availability of the two risks, the ease and the frequency with which\nthey come to mind. Gruesome images, endlessly repeated in the media,\ncause everyone to be on edge. As I know from experience, it is difficult to\nreason oneself into a state of complete calm. Terrorism speaks directly to System 1. Where do I come down in the debate between my friends? Availability\ncascades are real and they undoubtedly distort priorities in the allocation\nof public resources. Cass Sunstein would seek mechanisms that insulate\ndecision makers from public pressures, letting the allocation of resources\nbe determined by impartial experts who have a broad view of all risks and\nof the resources available to reduce them. Paul Slovic trusts the experts much less and the public somewhat more than Sunstein does, and he\npoints out that insulating the experts from the emotions of the public\nproduces policies that the public will reject\u2014an impossible situation in a\ndemocracy. Both are eminently sensible, and I agree with both.\nI share Sunstein\u2019s discomfort with the influence of irrational fears and\navailability cascades on public policy in the domain of risk. However, I also\nshare Slovic\u2019s belief that widespread fears, even if they are unreasonable,\nshould not be ignored by policy makers. Rational or not, fear is painful and\ndebilitating, and policy makers must endeavor to protect the public from\nfear, not only from real dangers.\nSlovic rightly stresses the resistance of the public to the idea of\ndecisions being made by unelected and unaccountable experts.\nFurthermore, availability cascades may have a long-term benefit by calling\nattention to classes of risks and by increasing the overall size of the riskreduction budget. The Love Canal incident may have caused excessive\nresources to be allocated to the management of toxic betwaste, but it also\nhad a more general effect in raising the priority level of environmental\nconcerns. Democracy is inevitably messy, in part because the availability\nand affect heuristics that guide citizens\u2019 beliefs and attitudes are inevitably\nbiased, even if they generally point in the right direction. Psychology should\ninform the design of risk policies that combine the experts\u2019 knowledge with\nthe public\u2019s emotions and intuitions.",
    "The third task in the sequence was administered to graduate students in psychology, and it is the critical one: rank the fields of specialization in order of the likelihood that Tom W is now a graduate student in each of these fields. The members of this prediction group knew the relevant statistical facts: they were familiar with the base rates of the different fields, and they knew that the source of Tom W\u2019s description was not highly trustworthy. However, we expected them to focus exclusively on the similarity of the description to the stereotypes\u2014we called it representativeness\u2014ignoring both the base rates and the doubts about the veracity of the description. They would then rank the small specialty\u2014 computer science\u2014as highly probable, because that outcome gets the highest representativeness score. Amos and I worked hard during the year we spent in Eugene, and I sometimes stayed in the office through the night. One of my tasks for such a night was to make up a description that would pit representativeness and base rates against each other. Tom W was the result of my efforts, and I completed the description in the early morning hours. The first person who showed up to work that morning was our colleague and friend Robyn Dawes, who was both a sophisticated statistician and a skeptic about the validity of intuitive judgment. If anyone would see the relevance of the base rate, it would have to be Robyn. I called Robyn over, gave him the question I had just typed, and asked him to guess Tom W\u2019s profession. I still remember his sly smile as he said tentatively, \u201ccomputer scientist?\u201d That was a happy moment\u2014even the mighty had fallen. Of course, Robyn immediately recognized his mistake as soon as I mentioned \u201cbase rate,\u201d but he had not spontaneously thought of it. Although he knew as much as anyone about the role of base rates in prediction, he neglected them when presented with the description of an individual\u2019s personality. As expected, he substituted a judgment of representativeness for the probability he was asked to assess. Amos and I then collected answers to the same question from 114 graduate students in psychology at three major universities, all of whom had taken several courses in statistics. They did not disappoint us. Their rankings of the nine fields by probability did not differ from ratings by similarity to the stereotype. Substitution was perfect in this case: there was no indication that the participants did anything else but judge representativeness. The question about probability (likelihood) was difficult, but the question about similarity was easier, and it was answered instead. This is a serious mistake, because judgments of similarity and probak tbility are not constrained by the same logical rules. It is entirely acceptable for judgments of similarity to be unaffected by base rates and also by the possibility that the description was inaccurate, but anyone who ignores base rates and the quality of evidence in probability assessments will certainly make mistakes. The concept \u201cthe probability that Tom W studies computer science\u201d is not a simple one. Logicians and statisticians disagree about its meaning, and some would say it has no meaning at all. For many experts it is a measure of subjective degree of belief. There are some events you are sure of, for example, that the sun rose this morning, and others you consider impossible, such as the Pacific Ocean freezing all at once. Then there are many events, such as your next-door neighbor being a computer scientist, to which you assign an intermediate degree of belief\u2014which is your probability of that event. Logicians and statisticians have developed competing definitions of probability, all very precise. For laypeople, however, probability (a synonym of likelihood in everyday language) is a vague notion, related to uncertainty, propensity, plausibility, and surprise. The vagueness is not particular to this concept, nor is it especially troublesome. We know, more or less, what we mean when we use a word such as democracy or beauty and the people we are talking to understand, more or less, what we intended to say. In all the years I spent asking questions about the probability of events, no one ever raised a hand to ask me, \u201cSir, what do you mean by probability?\u201d as they would have done if I had asked them to assess a strange concept such as globability. Everyone acted as if they knew how to answer my questions, although we all understood that it would be unfair to ask them for an explanation of what the word means. People who are asked to assess probability are not stumped, because they do not try to judge probability as statisticians and philosophers use the word. A question about probability or likelihood activates a mental shotgun, evoking answers to easier questions. One of the easy answers is an automatic assessment of representativeness\u2014routine in understanding language. The (false) statement that \u201cElvis Presley\u2019s parents wanted him to be a dentist\u201d is mildly funny because the discrepancy between the images of Presley and a dentist is detected automatically. System 1 generates an impression of similarity without intending to do so. The representativeness heuristic is involved when someone says \u201cShe will win the election; you can see she is a winner\u201d or \u201cHe won\u2019t go far as an academic; too many tattoos.\u201d We rely on representativeness when we judge the potential leadership of a candidate for office by the shape of his chin or the forcefulness of his speeches. Although it is common, prediction by representativeness is not statistically optimal. Michael Lewis\u2019s bestselling Moneyball is a story about the inefficiency of this mode of prediction. Professional baseball scouts traditionally forecast the success of possible players in part by their build and look. The hero of Lewis\u2019s book is Billy Beane, the manager of the Oakland A\u2019s, who made the unpopular decision to overrule his scouts and to select players by the statistics of past performance. The players the A\u2019s picked were inexpensive, because other teams had rejected them for not looking the part. The team soon achieved excellent results at low cost.",
    "Don\u2019t Miss the Geminid Meteor Shower \u2013 And Check Out NASA\u2019s Live Meteor Camera\n\nThe Geminids are caused by debris from a celestial object known as 3200 Phaethon, whose origin is the subject of some debate. Some astronomers consider it to be an extinct comet, based on observations showing some small amount of material leaving Phaethon\u2019s surface. Others argue that it has to be an asteroid because of its orbit and its similarity to the main-belt asteroid Pallas.\n\nWhatever the nature of Phaethon, observations show that the Geminids are denser than meteors belonging to other showers, enabling them to get as low as 29 miles above Earth\u2019s surface before burning up. Meteors belonging to other showers, like the Perseids, burn up much higher.\n\nThe Geminids can be seen by most of the world. Yet, it is best viewed by observers in the Northern Hemisphere. As you enter the Southern Hemisphere and move towards the South Pole, the altitude of the Geminid radiant \u2013 the celestial point in the sky where the Geminid meteors appear to originate \u2013 gets lower and lower above the horizon. Thus, observers in these locations see fewer Geminids than their northern counterparts.\n\nAll meteors appear to come from the same place in the sky, which is called the radiant. The Geminids appear to radiate from a point in the constellation Gemini, hence the name \u201cGeminids.\u201d The graphic shows the radiants of 388 meteors with speeds of 35 km/s observed by the NASA Fireball Network in December 2020. All the radiants are in Gemini, which means they belong to the Geminid shower. Credit: NASA\n\nBesides the weather, the phase of the Moon is a major factor in determining whether a meteor shower will have good rates during any given year. This is because the moonlight \u201cwashes out\u201d the fainter meteors, resulting in sky watchers seeing the fewer bright ones. This year, the Moon will be almost 80% full at the peak of the Geminids, which isn\u2019t ideal for our highly regarded meteor shower. Nevertheless, that bright Moon is expected to set around 2:00 a.m. wherever you are located, leaving a couple of hours for meteor watching until twilight.\n\n\u201cRich in green-colored fireballs, the Geminids are the only shower I will brave cold December nights to see,\u201d said Bill Cooke, lead for NASA\u2019s Meteoroid Environment Office, located at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nNASA will broadcast a live stream of the shower\u2019s peak December 13-14 via a meteor camera at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, (if our weather cooperates!), starting at 8 p.m. CST on the NASA Meteor Watch Facebook page.\n\nMeteor videos recorded by the All Sky Fireball Network are also available each morning to identify Geminids in these videos \u2013 just look for events labeled \u201cGEM.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the Geminids below:\n\nWhy are they called the Geminids?\n\nAll meteors associated with a shower have similar orbits, and they all appear to come from the same place in the sky, which is called the radiant. The Geminids appear to radiate from a point in the constellation Gemini, hence the name \u201cGeminids.\u201d\n\nHow fast are Geminids?\n\nGeminids travel 78,000 mph (35 km/s). This is over 1000 times faster than a cheetah, about 250 times faster than the swiftest car in the world, and over 40 times faster than a speeding bullet!\n\nHow to observe the Geminids?\n\nIf it\u2019s not cloudy, get away from bright lights, lie on your back, and look up. Remember to let your eyes get adjusted to the dark \u2013 you\u2019ll see more meteors that way. Keep in mind, this adjustment can take approximately 30 minutes. Don\u2019t look at your cell phone screen, as it will ruin your night vision!\n\nMeteors can generally be seen all over the sky. Avoid watching the radiant because meteors close to it have very short trails and are easily missed. When you see a meteor, try to trace it backwards. If you end up in the constellation Gemini, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve seen a Geminid.\n\nObserving in a city with lots of light pollution will make it difficult to see Geminids. You may only see a handful during the night in that case.\n\nWhen is the best time to observe Geminids?\n\nThe best night to see the shower is December 13/14. Sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere can go out in the late evening hours on December 13 to see some Geminids, but with moonlight and radiant low in the sky, you may not see many meteors.\n\nBest rates will be seen when the radiant is highest in the sky around 2:00 a.m. local time, including the Southern Hemisphere, on December 14. The Moon will set around the same time. Therefore, observing from moonset until twilight on December 14 should yield the most meteors.\n\nYou can still see Geminids on other nights, before or after December 13-14, but the rates will be much lower. The last Geminids can be seen December 17.\n\nHow many Geminids can observers expect to see December 13/14?\n\nRealistically, the predicated rate for observers in the northern hemisphere is closer to 30-40 meteors per hour. Observers in the Southern Hemisphere will see fewer Geminids than those in the northern hemisphere \u2013 perhaps 25% of rates in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nAlthough this year\u2019s conditions are not the best for viewing the Geminid meteor shower, it will still be a good show to catch in our night skies.",
    "Nearly 6 weeks after the introduction of the controversial National Security Law in Hong Kong, we look at the impact of the bill.\n\nAs China continues to arrest Hong Kongers at a staggering rate, the wide focus of the incarcerations has somewhat shifted away from the protesters of yesterday, and towards media moguls and anti-Beijing journalists. Celebrated pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow - hailed as the real Mulan for her courageous fight for the freedom of Hong Kong and selfless sacrifice of her UK citizenship - was arrested on Monday along with Jimmy Lai, a fierce anti-Beijing media mogul. Amnesty International has previously called arrests of Mrs Chow \u201can outrageous assault\u201d on freedom of expression. Mrs Chow described her experience as \u201cterrifying\u201d. \n\nWhile countless of individuals will find themselves in the custody of the mainland Chinese authorities, the government continues to silence those who disagree with their policies and aggression. If you watch the videos online, the brutal treatment Hong Kongers can expect from the Chinese police forces (the ironic similarities between the police forces in western Europe and the USA, the all-round use of unnecessary force and extensive teargas, is a sad reality) is self evident.\n\nIf you read the accounts of Simon Cheng, a former British consulate worker abducted in August of last year, one can presume the violent and brutal torture that awaits Hong Kongers that are exported to mainland China. Or perhaps they will be joining the Uyghurs for the \u201csummer camps\u201d China has provided, summer camps which include barbed wire, forced consumption of pork and alcohol (forbidden in Islam), and death.  Or perhaps they could be taken to Tibet, where the Chinese enact forced abortions, torture, infanticide and extrajudicial executions. This is a fate awaiting millions, and a fate already suffered by millions, at the hands of the CCP.\n\nWhile Dominic Raab (UK foreign secretary) has condemned the new National Security Law, which allowed China to send its police force into the enclave for the first time, largely with impunity, Beijing have stated that they will not tolerate foreign interference with its \u201cdomestic\u201d affairs. And while the UK government has made positive declarations of solidarity with Hong Kong, the Chinese government continues to restrict the liberties of the island territory, thus making these effort unsatisfactory. The West abides, China arrests more protesters. \n\nWhen we compare Hong Kong to Tibet, invaded by China in the 1950s, we reach a depressing conclusion. The CCP will not stop as a result of feeble international pressure against these abuses. It has been 70 years since China invaded Tibet, and the British government, despite indicating the contrary, still has no interest in changing the status quo of torture, oppression and cultural genocide, because it would be financially damaging. Hong Kong and the names of these brave individuals, will fade out of existence before long, should Western government choose the same path as it did with Tibet; the path that we are currently on.\n\nJoshua Wong, another frontline activist and hero of the pro-democracy movement, states that Hong Kong will continue to resist; but what happens when the media and these leaders have been silenced, or have fled abroad?

    "Convolutional Neural Networks are currently the state-of-the-art model when it comes to tasks involving visual data. They find application in image recognition and classification, image analysis, computer vision, and many other problems and fields. However, training and achieving the optimal CNN for a task is a very power-, time- and memory-consuming process. Not only is training a network very expensive, but developing its generalization capabilities requires additional work. \nSome research has already been done into optimizing networks' generalization. One method is simplifying the complexity of the network by removing the unnecessary structures within the model which were originally looking for overly specific features in the data (pruning). Training the structure of the network instead of the weight values is another approach for making it more generalizable. That can be achieved, for example, by evolving the architecture using a genetic algorithm. \nHowever, those methods are utilized with the aim to increase the generalizability within the task and dataset the model was trained on. Little attention is paid to whether the network can generalize beyond that and perform accurately on related tasks. Often the network's generalization is not even mentioned or is left as an afterthought with the main focus falling on creating a more compact and faster network. While that is indeed a problem that must be addressed, we believe that making the CNN more generalizable is crucial for a number of reasons. \nIt would mean that training a single model is enough to do multiple related tasks, thus eliminating the need for spending time on learning multiple task-specific networks. Furthermore, we think that a more general network is tightly connected to a simpler structure which would directly affect the space and power consumption in a positive way. Finally, we believe that research into multi-tasking and optimizing generalization is warranted as it brings us closer to general purpose Artificial Intelligence. \nWe tackle the problem of creating a ``general\" CNN for image classification. The contribution of this thesis is the proposed novel approach for achieving that goal:\nOur work focuses on the network architecture and not its weights. We aim to create a model which encodes all information about the data in its structure and performs tasks adequately even when the weights are given random values (a so called ``Weight-Agnostic Neural Network\u201d).\nWe start with a pre-trained net, which already has a good performance in classifying image data. We prune unnecessary parts of the structure using a genetic algorithm, and thus we increase the generalizability and decrease the risk of overfitting.\nWe ensure a network can perform multiple tasks by evaluating its performance on random samples from different datasets (``joint evaluation\").\nUsing the described method, we create a PADAWANN (Pruning-Attained Diversified Artificial Weight-Agnostic Neural Network), which addresses the problem of generalization on multiple levels. And thus, we answer the question: Can we create a ``general\" topology for image classification by pruning a pre-trained model and evolving it in a weight- and task-agnostic way? We present our experiments and their results, which show that this approach is one worth considering. While not on the level of state-of-the-art models, our PADAWANN is promising and achieves around 72-75% accuracy on multiple tasks! We hope that our demonstration of the usefulness of weight agnosticism and the benefits of ``joint evaluation\" will spark interest and inspire further work into this domain. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: First, in Chapter 2 we will introduce the core concepts and theory that we will build on in this thesis. Chapter 3 shows what methods other computing scientists have already tried and tested. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the problem of this thesis and the strategy we have deployed to tackle it, and Chapter 5 will present and analyze our results. Lastly, a reflection on the proposed approach and directions for further work will be presented in Chapter 6, and our conclusions are summarized in Chapter 7.\n\nPreliminaries\nIn this chapter we introduce the fundamental concepts and terminology this thesis works with and builds on. We focus on Neural Networks (NNs), neural pruning, network architecture search (NAS) and genetic algorithms (GAs).\n Neural Networks \nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs, or simply NNs) are computer systems inspired by the biological neural networks. More specifically, they mimic the way neurons in the brain receive a signal, process it and transmit it to other neurons via their synapses. NNs have ``nodes\" which receive signal, can transform it and transfer it to another node via the edge connecting them. The transformation happening at each artificial neuron is dictated by an activation function, which defines how the weighted sum of the inputs is turned into an output. The artificial neurons are usually aggregated into multiple levels, and when that is the case, the net is called a Deep Neural Network.\n How Does It Work? \nThe input neurons in the first layer receive the ``raw\" signal. They process and possibly transform it and then send it to the neurons of the next layer (called hidden neurons), which also process the signal and pass it on. This procedure repeats until the signal reaches the last layer and is transformed by an activation function one last time by the output neurons which generate the NN's result. The weight assigned to an edge defines how important a connection is. Thus, while the signal is being transmitted between neurons, that weight can increase or decrease its strength. In other words, the weights encode the information needed for the network to perform its task.  \nThis process of taking in an external input, processing it, and producing output is called forward propagation.\nMost often training the NN to do a certain task consists of letting the network do the task in question, evaluating its performance, and then performing the so called ``back propagation\". The process involves going backwards from the output layer towards the input layer and adjusting the weights of the edges according to the calculated error information. These few steps are repeated until the loss is minimal, or the accuracy is maximal. A training set of data is used for learning the best values of the weights, while the evaluation is done on an unseen before test set, with the two datasets being of the same nature. \nNeural Networks have found a large application in a myriad of fields, which has led to the emergence of many different types of nets. We will only discuss the ones used in the thesis.\n\n Convolutional Neural Networks \nA classifier is a model whose task is to take a sample and identify which category out of a set of possible ones it belongs to. For instance, an NN which takes in a picture of an animal and as result decides which animal is depicted is a classifier. \nJust like in this example, we will focus solely on networks that classify images. The preferred model for image classification tasks currently is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is a deep neural network that takes images as an input and learns their most important aspects and features in order to be able to tell them apart. It is capable of capturing spatial and temporal dependencies, which is necessary for image classification. \nThe input of a CNN is an image (or in technical terms, data with three dimensions: height, width, number of channels that corresponds to the color scale). Each neuron processes data in a specified ``receptive field\" of the image. The neurons are ordered in layers in such a way that first simpler patterns are detected, and later on - more complex ones. To illustrate, we present an example with the MNIST digit 8 (fig. 2), which a CNN is trying to correctly classify. The first few layers in the network identify for their own slice of the image what pattern there is (fig. 3), and whether there are any curves or lines present. The layers after that look for more complicated shapes: a circle in the upper part of the image, and in the lower part of the image (fig. 4). Only after establishing that both are present in the picture, the convolutional net classifies the image as an 8.\nThis procedure is accomplished with the help of the convolutional layers which are not used in typical NNs. This layer performs the dot product between the receptive field of a neuron and a set of learn-able parameters (called the kernel). It outputs a ``feature map\" which contains information about the input and its features from that particular part of the image. It is important to note that each kernel is unique and corresponds to a single segment of the image. A collection of kernels is called a filter. \nAnother CNN-specific layer is the pooling one. It follows convolutional layers and replaces their outputs at certain places by derived summary statistics of the nearby outputs. This achieves reduction in the spatial size of the representation. Convolution is a linear operation (but images are not linear), so non-linearity layers often appear after a convolutional layer to introduce non-linearity.\n\n Neural Architecture Search \nA neural network's topology refers to the way its neurons are connected and it is crucial for the network's performance. ``Structure\" and ``architecture\" are often used as synonyms for topology. \nNeural Architecture Search (NAS) is a method for creating an NN's architecture automatically, instead of manually by a human (which is a rather time-consuming process, prone to mistakes). NAS focuses on the neurons, their connections, and their distribution into layers, and not on the values of the weights. Finding the best architecture for a specific task before training the weights can boost the performance. This stems from the fact that topology has a direct effect on the generalization abilities of a neural network as well as its training time. \nSome research focuses solely on the structure and even disregards the weights completely by keeping them constant, or sampling them randomly.\nDifferent methods have been proposed for obtaining the optimal network architecture. One commonly used approach for NAS is deploying algorithms that evolve the structure (such as Genetic Algorithms, which will be explained in depth in section 2.4. Pruning (explained in section 2.3) can also be utilized for architecture search, especially when whole filters are removed because the pruned architecture is more important for the model's efficacy than the leftover weights. Moreover, a combination of pruning and GAs has also been considered.\n\n Network Pruning \nNeural Networks typically have a large amount of parameters (number of neurons, number of weights, number of layers, types of layers, etc.), which makes them memory intensive. Furthermore, NNs are extremely computationally heavy. Training requires repeatedly doing 1) a forward pass with memorizing the floating point values of millions of weights and activation functions, and 2) back propagation where they are all adjusted. It also involves thousands of data samples. Because of those factors and limited hardware resources and computing power, training is a slow process. It is made even slower if the architecture contains a large amount of neurons and connections between them. \nA model is overfitting if the accuracy achieved on training samples is high, but once tested on unseen samples, the accuracy suddenly drops. This occurs when the network does not generalize well because it has introduced more parameters and feature-checks than needed, or is using an unnecessarily convoluted approach that is not optimal. Therefore, overfitting or over-parametrization is a result of the model violating Occam's razor (which dictates that when choosing between solutions to a problem, the simplest solution should be favored). Consequently, an overfitting model has poor performance. Not only that; Because of the unnecessary additional connections, it needs more computational power and storage space. One way to mitigate this problem is reducing the complexity of the model. \nNetwork Pruning is a method for simplifying and sparsifying a neural network by removing redundant branches. The purpose of pruning is to increase the speed of the network's performance and decrease its storage size. Moreover, network pruning can affect the NN's performance. It helps the model generalize better and avoid overfitting. This is because the removed redundant weights are typically ones formed on the basis of extremely specific occurrences in the training data which are not representative of the data's features.\nOne approach, unstructured pruning, is to find the least important weights and prune them individually. Structured pruning, on the other hand, involves groups of weights and neurons (whole channels or filters) being removed together at once. This can be done as part of a two-step process where removing connections is followed by retraining the net. The two steps can even be done multiple times in an iterative manner. Another way to prune a network is using a Genetic Algorithm.\n\n Genetic Algorithms \nA Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a method for solving search and optimization problems based on the principle of evolution and natural selection. The GA takes an initial population of candidate solutions to a problem (called ``individuals\") and evolves them towards more and more optimal solutions. The individuals have a set of properties (or ``genes\") which are the focus of the GA, and get altered as they are passed from one generation to another.\n Evolving NNs \nOne can deploy a GA on an initial population of neural networks to evolve a network structure that is best fitting for performing a certain task, or to train the weights in fixed architectures. We focus on evolving the network's topology, which already has a lot of dedicated research. In that case the genes are the network's parameters. \nIn the initialization of the algorithm a population of sparse and simple neural networks is randomly generated. Next, they are evaluated on a task using the so called ``fitness function\" which summarizes how close this individual is to accurately doing its task. Based on the scores, only the highest-ranking networks are selected for ``breeding\" to create a new generation and pass on their genes. The new individuals share most of the features of their parents, except that a new connection, or neuron, or a whole layer or filter (in the case of CNNs) is added randomly. An activation function can possibly also be changed. There is usually a small chance of mutation, which allows for completely random parameter values to be introduced. It also ensures that the models do not get stuck in a local minimum or maximum. \nThe GA can be terminated for a number of reasons: once a network with accuracy above a certain threshold is found; when a specific number of generations has passed; if the successive populations no longer produce better results than the ones before them; etc.\n Pruning NNs \nA GA can also be used for pruning neural networks. This process is almost the inverse of evolving NNs, although it uses the same genes and once again aims to produce a network with an optimal performance.  \nThe usual approach is taking a pre-trained network and creating an initial population out of it by copying it multiple times and pruning some part of the structure from each copy. Once again, the individuals are evaluated and only the best performing ones are chosen to create the next generation. The new population shares most of the features of their parent but some part of its architecture is pruned to make the network simpler (and possibly mutation has occurred). The process is illustrated in figure 6. \nOnce again, the GA can be terminated for many reasons, and its result is a much less complex network than the original.\nRelated Work \nIn this chapter, I will describe the state-of-the-art research already conducted by scientists: pruning methods, ways to implement a genetic algorithm, methods for obtaining ``general\" topologies (transfer learning, multi-task learning), and creating a weight-agnostic network.\n\n Research \nIn this chapter, I will describe the problem in more depth. Then I will give my proposed solution, providing all details about the algorithm I create and what it does, what design and implementation choices I made and their motivation. Finally, I will describe the experiments that I conducted.\n\n Results \nIn this chapter, I will display the results obtained from my experiments in multiple tables and graphs. I will compare the results to the state-of-the-art CNNs which are only trained to do a single task and to other multi-tasking CNNs. I will then discuss whether the results are what I expected and where my PADAWANN fits in with the rest of the existing models.\n\n Discussion And Future Work \nIn this chapter, we reflect on the proposed strategy and experiments conducted for this project. We discuss alternative steps that we could have taken, and propose directions for further future research.\n Reflection \n Overall Remarks \nThe results we observe are promising. We do not achieve accuracy on the level of current state-of-the-art models, but that seems reasonable. The networks we compare the PADAWANN to are either human-tailored for great performance or use methods that are tried and tested, and have been improved on for decades. It would have been a miracle if our network surpassed them on the first try. The accuracy of the PADAWANN is about 12\\% lower than that of hand-crafted CNNs and 10% lower than that of models obtained automatically. This difference in performance possibly comes from the fact that not all possible ways for designing our algorithm were explored to find the optimal one. (We will go into more details about possible alternatives in section 6.3.) \nWhile space-efficiency and speed-up are not the main focus of our work, the resulting model is 13 times sparser than the original and has no weight information to be saved. This makes it very convenient for storing and faster to use. This ``by-product\" of the research makes the idea of creating a PADAWANN even more appealing. \nOverall, we believe that our proposed approach is worth further investigation. Weight-agnostic networks in particular should be given more attention because of the high generalization they achieve. Based on the ablation study we conducted, we can conclude that training the network's architecture instead of weights is what contributes the most to increasing the generalization ability of the resulting model. Keeping the weights of the original net and re-training them after pruning, results in a network with accuracy 5% lower than the PADAWANN's. That definitely raises curiosity of how useful weight agnosticism can be for neural architecture search in general, and other techniques such as transfer learning.\n Design Choices \nElitism.  In our investigation of a fitting implementation of the genetic algorithm we considered not utilizing the elitism technique. However, in those experiments on multiple occasions well-performing networks do not make it to the next generation, while networks with smaller accuracy do. This is due to the fact that we randomly sample the population for the tournament selection and there is possibility that some networks never get picked for that operation. When employing elitism we ensure that the best performing model is copied to the next generation and its genes do not get lost. Our experiments show that it is a good decision. \nMixed Pruning.  Another observation according to the experiment results is that the pruning method we are using is quite efficient. The plot of the best models' accuracy after each epoch reveals that the performance stays on par the whole time with very small drops. We did some initial try-outs with unstructured pruning, but the algorithm took almost twice as long to get close to the accuracy values obtained with our current approach, which is why we opted out of that method. Structured pruning was also promising according to the tests we ran, but we decided to choose mixed over structured pruning because it leads to higher parameter reduction. \nOccam's Razor.  In our tournament selection implementation we follow Occam's Razor to prefer simpler models over more complex ones if they have comparable performance. This greatly helps reduce the number of parameters of the model and increase the generalization. We believe that it contributes to the algorithm a lot, which is further proven by one of the ablation experiments: Without taking complexity in account, the topology we create is at most 9 times sparser than the original pre-trained model. That is about 4 times larger than the PADAWANN we create. We do not aim to optimize the complexity of the model's architecture. However, we can clearly see a connection between the generalization ability of the PADAWANN with and without favoring less complex structure (accuracy of 76% and 71% respectively).\n\n Future Work \nThis research was quite narrow in its experimentation with different genetic algorithm approaches, types of pruning, freedom of parameters. That is due to the fact that it is intended as a proof of concept: The aim is to test whether our proposed method can be successfully applied for creating a general image classification topology; not to find the optimal way to do that. Our results show that it is indeed a possible solution for the problem, and therefore, further exploration is needed. \nWe utilize mixed pruning as it is a method already proven to achieve great compression for almost no accuracy loss. However, we believe that more experiments with only unstructured pruning are worth conducting. It is possible that pruning multiple edges at a time (instead of a single one as we tried) will lead to a more time-efficient algorithm and possibly good compression rate. Furthermore, experimenting with structured pruning is another direction for future work. \nOur genetic algorithm is quite simplistic and does not involve crossover between individual networks. Research into including crossover in the algorithm is an interesting prospect. We believe that since the weight values have no importance, ``gluing\" the first half of a network to the second half of another network should not decrease the performance of the resulting net (and might even improve it). Different approaches to crossover can also be experimented with. However, this will be an expensive operation. \nExperimenting with the weight values is another idea for future research. Making them agnostic is a crucial part of the algorithm, but that can be achieved in ways different from ours. For instance, sampling the shared weight value from a bigger range might lead to different results. Furthermore, setting a random value to all weights and keeping it constant throughout the whole algorithm is worth considering. \nOne last direction for research would be to apply the genetic algorithm in reverse: simple sparse networks to be evolved into complex ones. The experiment would be similar to the one that inspired this work. However, it will focus on CNNs instead of feed-forward networks, and on creating a general topology instead of a model that performs well on a single task only. \n ",
    "In their paper, Thagard and Verbeurgt characterize the problem of coherence. They also propose methods to compute approximate solutions to that problem, and this commentary reflects on the theoretical claims made about one of those approaches.\nThe authors explain coherence on the computational level and thus describe what the cognitive system does, not how it does it (as defined by Marr). Their definition is in terms of accepting or rejecting elements to maximize the satisfaction of positive and negative constraints between them. One possible formalization is assigning truth values to graph vertices in a way that produces a maximum number of ``satisfied\" edges.\nThagard and Verbeurgt reason about possible strategies to compute coherence (i.e. to create an algorithmic level implementation). They conclude that the only method consistent with the computational explanation is to consider all different ways of accepting and rejecting elements. However, this exhaustive approach is impossible to execute by the human brain or a computer even for small problem instances. Consequently, the authors make a strong claim: ``Coherence problems are inherently intractable computationally, in the sense that, under widely held assumptions of computational complexity theory, there are no efficient (polynomial-time) procedures for solving them.\" \nThus, the problem of computing coherence turns into a problem of approximating it. The authors propose five algorithms, one of which is the connectionist. This approach essentially translates the elements and constraints into the nodes and links of a neural network and the objective is to maximize the ``harmony\" of that network. However, the algorithm cannot guarantee an optimal solution, because it may fall into a local maximum.\nThagard and Verbeurgt make another strong claim which I find problematic in combination with the aforementioned one. They state that ``[n]eural networks provide an efficient means for approximately solving the hard computational problem of computing coherence\".\nAlthough the algorithm maximizes the value of coherence between elements corresponding to their truth assignment, that does not necessarily mean it also produces a truth assignment similar to the optimal one. Approximating the optimal structure polynomially is impossible, since it would require some knowledge of it (and computing it is intractable). Because neural networks operate in polynomial time, we can conclude that they guarantee only an approximation of the coherence value.\nValue approximation solves the intractability issue if the aim of the problem is finding an optimal way to carry out a task. For instance, in the Traveling Salesman problem the goal is to visit all given cities via the shortest roads possible. The focus falls on traversing all cities in a cheap manner, not the particular path taken to do so. Another example is the Knapsack problem, in which the objective is to place as many items as possible in a bag with a weight limit. Here what is important is choosing items whose combined weight is maximally large and still below the limit, not the relationship between the items. On the other hand, when it comes to cognition we want to create a realistic and accurate model of what a cognizer does. We deal with problems that explain the structure of cognitive processes, which is why we need structure approximation.\nFigure 1 visualizes the difference between the two approximations on a specific instance. As illustrated, there can be a truth assignment which is the exact opposite of the optimal one yet still approximates the optimal coherence value well. When the structure is approximated, the number of correctly assigned truth values is maximized which results in a solution more similar to the optimal one. Because of those properties we are interested in the assignment of truth values resembling the optimal one more so than we are in maximizing the coherence value corresponding to that assignment. Structure approximation is, however, not guaranteed by value approximation, which is all neural networks can offer for computing coherence.\nIn conclusion, the authors' claim that neural networks solve the intractability issue of computing coherence is problematic if the problem is indeed intractable. The value approximation they achieve is not adequate for explaining cognitive processes, and for them to accomplish structure approximation in polynomial time would be impossible unless P = NP.",
    "The vanStempvoort-Handke-Hens-Gerrits-Janssen model (henceforth referred to as SHHGJ-model) accurately reflects the general idea of representational distortion (RD), but struggles to achieve the intended generality. This commentary will discuss precisely this problem.\n\nThe SHHGJ-model is formalized as follows model: The input consists of the representations of two entities a, b which can be from any (or the same) domain, two functions mapA, mapB which alter the domains of the first and second representation depending on contextual information, and a set of basic transformations. The output is the length of the shortest sequence of transformations required to transform one of the representations into the other.\n\nTo summarize, the SHHGJ-model calculates the similarity between two representations as the smallest number of transformations needed to convert one into the other. Therefore, it is successful in capturing the informal idea underlying representational distortion that the similarity between two entities is a function of the complexity required to transform the representation of one into the representation of the other. However, the authors seem to aim for high precision by first following the application of RD in Hahn et al.'s experiments before following the verbal theory, and introducing details that go beyond the computational level. Because of this, the model has a problematic property: it does not maintain the degree of abstraction that Hahn et al. establish.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that the functions mapA and mapB do not reflect the definition of RD, but build on it. The verbal theory aims for generality by not giving details about the domains of the entities and their representations. The authors, however, model their interpretation of Hahn et al.'s first experiment about the possible transformations depending on how the representations are viewed (i.e. context). Yet this experiment is just one implementation of the theory on a specific case. Marr's levels of analysis determine that the computational level explains what a system does, while the algorithmic one focuses on how the system does it (and what representations it makes use of). Because RD only describes what transformations-based similarity is, its formalization must reflect that in terms of input and output without being concerned with possible ways to implement them. The algorithmic, not the computational, level should handle details such as entities being interpreted differently based on contextual information. Moreover, even if specifying the context would make the model more precise without compromising its generality, I believe that altering the entities' domain is an unrelated operation. The authors raise a point about the transformations which become available (or not) to representations according to context -- thus, it seems more fitting to utilize a function that influences the set of transformations, not the entities' domains.\n\nFurthermore, the output of the SHHGJ-model is a specific implementation of the similarity measure which Hahn et al. keep abstract: they do not clarify whether it takes a numerical, geometrical, materialistic form, or something else entirely. In the conducted experiments they choose to implement it as the number of transformations needed to go from one representation to the other. However, the number of transformations is only an approximate measure and this approximation is just one way to represent the similarity on the algorithmic level. In the computational-level model it should be expressed more generally, because ``RD encompasses a broad family of measures\".\n\nOn the other hand, the chosen set of transformations is also guided by the experiments, but is still representative of the theory. Hahn et al. do not constrain the set beyond excluding any implausible transformations in their definition of RD, but they limit it to the set of ``basic\" transformations in their first experiment. Although the authors appear to model an aspect of the experiment instead of the theory, it can be argued that since transformations are of different complexity and nature, some are derivative of others and thus a set of only ``basic transformations\" can be sufficiently general to include all possible transformations.\n\nI suggest two changes in order to improve the formalization so it conveys the correct amount of detail. Firstly, the functions may be simply omitted from the input specification or modified such that they affect the set of feasible transformations and not the entity domains. Secondly, I propose the output to be changed to an abstract ``similarity measure,\" which can correspond to the length of the minimal sequence of transformations that the authors already make use of. With those modifications, I believe that the SHHGJ-model will correctly convey not only the idea of representational distortion, but also its intended generality.",
    "A comprehensive and quantitative comparison of text-mining in 15 million full-text articles versus their corresponding abstracts\nAbstract\nAcross academia and industry, text mining has become a popular strategy for keeping up with the rapid growth of the scientific literature. Text mining of the scientific literature has mostly been carried out on collections of abstracts, due to their availability. Here we present an analysis of 15 million English scientific full-text articles published during the period 1823\u20132016. We describe the development in article length and publication sub-topics during these nearly 250 years. We showcase the potential of text mining by extracting published protein\u2013protein, disease\u2013gene, and protein subcellular associations using a named entity recognition system, and quantitatively report on their accuracy using gold standard benchmark data sets. We subsequently compare the findings to corresponding results obtained on 16.5 million abstracts included in MEDLINE and show that text mining of full-text articles consistently outperforms using abstracts only.\nAuthor summary\nText mining has become an integral part of all fields in science. Owing to the large number of articles published every day, it is necessary to employ automated systems to assist in curation, knowledge management and discovery. To date, most systems make use of information collected from abstracts only. Moreover, studies on smaller collections of abstracts and full-text articles have demonstrated some information is available only in the full-text body. Nonetheless, to date there has been no large-scale comprehensive comparison of abstracts and full-text articles. In this work, we analyze a hitherto unprecedented collection of 15 million full-text articles. Through quantitative benchmarks we assess the difference between full-text articles and abstracts. Our findings confirm what has long been discussed, namely that access to the full-text body improved text mining greatly.\n\nIntroduction\nText mining has become a widespread approach to identify and extract information from unstructured text. Text mining is used to extract facts and relationships in a structured form that can be used to annotate specialized databases, to transfer knowledge between domains and more generally within business intelligence to support operational and strategic decision-making [1\u20133]. Biomedical text mining is concerned with the extraction of information regarding biological entities, such as genes and proteins, phenotypes, or even more broadly biological pathways (reviewed extensively in [3\u20139]) from sources like scientific literature, electronic patient records, and most recently patents [10\u201313]. Furthermore, the extracted information has been used as annotation of specialized databases and tools (reviewed in [3,14]). In addition, text mining is routinely used to support manual curation of biological databases [15,16]. Thus, text mining has become an integral part of many resources serving a wide audience of scientists. The main text source for scientific literature has been the MEDLINE corpus of abstracts, essentially due to the restricted availability of full-text articles. However, full-text articles are becoming more accessible and there is a growing interest in text mining of complete articles. Nevertheless, to date no studies have presented a systematic comparison of the performance comparing a very large number of abstracts and full-texts in corpora that are similar in size to MEDLINE.\n\nFull-text articles and abstracts are structurally different [17]. Abstracts are comprised of shorter sentences and very succinct text presenting only the most important findings. By comparison, full-text articles contain complex tables, display items and references. Moreover, they present existing and generally accepted knowledge in the introduction (often presented in the context of summaries of the findings), and move on to reporting more in-depth results, while discussion sections put the results in perspective and mention limitations and concerns. The latter is often considered to be more speculative compared to the abstract [3].\n\nWhile text-mining results from accessible full-text articles have already become an integral part of some databases (reviewed recently for protein-protein interactions [18]), very few studies to date have compared text mining of abstracts and full-text articles. Using a corpus consisting of ~20,000 articles from the PubMed Central (PMC) open-access subset and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), it was found that many explicit protein\u2013protein interactions only are mentioned in the full text [19]. Additionally, in a corpus of 1,025 full-text articles it was noticed that some pharmacogenomics associations are only found in the full text [20]. One study using a corpus of 3,800 articles with focus on Caenorhabditis elegans noted an increase in recall from 45% to 95% when including the full text [21]. Other studies have worked with even smaller corpora [17,22,23]. One study have even noted that the majority of claims within an article is not reported in the abstract [24]. Whilst these studies have been of significant interest, the number of full-text articles and abstracts used for comparison are nowhere near the magnitude of the actual number of scientific articles published to date, and it is thus unclear if the results can be generalized to the scientific literature as a whole. The earlier studies have mostly used articles retrieved from PMC in a structured XML file. However, full-text articles received or downloaded directly from the publishers often come in the PDF format, which must be converted to a raw unformatted text file. This presents a challenge, as the quality of the text mining will depend on the proper extraction and filtering of the unformatted text. A previous study dealt with this by writing custom software taking into account the structure and font of each journal at that time [21]. More recent studies typically provide algorithms that automatically determines the layout of the articles [25\u201327].\n\nIn this work, we describe a corpus of 15 million full-text scientific articles from Elsevier, Springer, and the open-access subset of PMC. The articles were published during the period 1823\u20132016. We highlight the possibilities by extracting protein\u2013protein associations, disease\u2013gene associations, and protein subcellular localization from the large collection of full-text articles using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system combined with a scoring of co-mentions. We quantitatively report the accuracy and performance using gold standard benchmark data sets. Lastly, we compare the findings to corresponding results obtained on the matching set of abstracts included in MEDLINE as well as the full set of 16.5 million MEDLINE abstracts.\n\nMethods\nMEDLINE corpus\nThe MEDLINE corpus consists of 26,385,631 citations. We removed empty citations, corrections and duplicate PubMed IDs. For duplicate PubMed IDs we kept only the newest entry. This led to a total of 16,544,511 abstracts for text mining.\n\nPMC corpus\nThe PubMed Central corpus comprises 1,488,927 freely available scientific articles (downloaded 27th January 2017). Each article was retrieved in XML format. The XML file contains the article divided into paragraphs, article category and meta-information such as journal, year published, etc. Articles that had a category matching Addendum, Corrigendum, Erratum or Retraction were discarded. A total of 5,807 documents were discarded due to this, yielding a total of 1,483,120 articles for text mining. The article paragraphs were extracted for text mining. No further pre-processing of the text was done. The journals were categorized according to categories (described in the following section) by matching the ISSN number. The number of pages for each article was also extracted from the XML, if possible.\n\nTDM corpus\nThe Technical Information Center of Denmark (DTU Library) TDM corpus is a collection of full-text articles from the publishers Springer and Elsevier. The corpus covers the period from 1823 to 2016. The corpus comprises 3,335,400 and 11,697,096 full-text articles in PDF format, respectively. An XML file containing meta-data such as publication date, journal, etc. accompanies each full-text article. PDF to TXT conversion was done using pdftotext v0.47.0, part of the Poppler suite (poppler.freedesktop.org). 192 articles could not be converted to text due to errors in the PDF file. The article length, counted as the number of pages, was extracted from the XML file. If not recorded in the XML file we counted the number of pages in the PDF file using the Unix tool pdfinfo v0.26.5. Articles were grouped into four bins, determined from the 25%, 50%, and 75% quantiles, respectively. These were found to be 1\u20134 pages (0\u201325%), 5\u20137 pages (25\u201350%), 8\u201310 pages (50\u201375%) and 11+ pages (75%-100%). Each article was, based on the journal where it was published, assigned to one or more of the following seventeen categories: Health Sciences, Chemistry, Life Sciences, Engineering, Physics, Agriculture Sciences, Material Science and Metallurgy, Earth Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Information Technology, Social Sciences, Business and Economy and Management, Arts and Humanities, Law, Telecommunications Technology, Library and Information Sciences. Due to the large number of categories, we condensed anything not in the top-6 into the category \u201cOther\u201d. The top-six categories health science, chemistry, life sciences, engineering, physics and agricultural sciences make up 74.8% of the data (S1 Fig). The assignment of categories used in this study was taken from the existing index for the journal made by the librarians at the DTU Library. For the temporal statistics, the years 1823\u20131900 were condensed into one.\n\nPre-processing of PDF-to-text converted documents\nFollowing the PDF-to-text conversion of the Springer and Elsevier articles we ran a language detection algorithm implemented in the python package langdetect v1.0.7 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/langdetect). We discarded 902,415 articles that were not identified as English. We pre-processed the remaining raw text from the articles as follows:\n\nNon-printable characters were removed using the POSIX filter [[:^print:]].\nA line of text was removed if digits make up more than 10% of the text, or symbols make up more than 10% of the text, or lowercase text was less than 50%. Symbols are anything not matching [0-9A-Za-z].\nRemoval of acknowledgments and reference- or bibliography-lists using a rule-based system explained below.\nText was split into sentences and paragraphs using a rule-based system described below.\nWe assumed that acknowledgments and reference lists are always at the end of the article. Upon encountering either of the terms: \u201cacknowledgment\u201d, \u201cbibliography\u201d, \u201cliterature cited\u201d, \u201cliterature\u201d, \u201creferences\u201d, and the following misspellings thereof: \u201crefirences\u201d, \u201cliteratur\u201d, \u201cr\u00e9f\u00e9rences\u201d, \u201creferesces\u201d. In some cases the articles had no heading indicating the start of a bibliography. We tried to take these cases into account by constructing a RegEx that matches the typical way of listing references (e.g. [1] Westergaard, \u2026). Such a pattern can be matched by the RegEx \u201c^\\[\\d+\\]\\s[A-Za-z]\u201d. The other commonly used pattern, \u201c1. Westergaard, \u2026\u201d, was avoided since it may also indicate a new heading. Keywords were identified based on several rounds of manual inspection. In each round, 100 articles in which the reference list had not been found was randomly selected and inspected. We were unable to find references in 286,287 and 2,896,144 Springer and Elsevier articles, respectively. Manual inspection of 100 randomly selected articles revealed that these articles indeed did not have a reference list or that the pattern was not easily describable with simple metrics, such as keywords and RegEx. Articles without references were not discarded.\n\nThe PDF to text conversion often breaks up paragraphs and sentences, due to new page, new column, etc. Paragraph and sentence splitting was performed using a ruled-based system. If the previous line of text does not end with a \u201c.!?\u201d, and the current line does not start with a lower-case letter, it is assumed that the line is part of the previous sentence. Otherwise, the line of text is assumed to be a new paragraph.\n\nText article filtering\nA number of Springer and Elsevier documents were removed due to technical issues post pre-processing. An article was removed if:\n\nArticle contained no text post-preprocessing (51,399 documents).\nAverage word length was below the 2% quantile (263,902 documents).\nArticle contained specific keywords, described below (286,958 documents).\nSome PDF files without texts are scans of the original article (point 1). We did not attempt to make an optical character recognition conversion (OCR) as the old typesetting fonts often are less compatible with present day OCR programs, and this can lead to text recognition errors [28,29]. For any discarded document, we still used the meta-data to calculate summary statistics. In some cases the PDF to text conversion failed, and produced non-sense data with a white space between the characters of a majority of the words (point 2). To empirically determine a cutoff we gradually increased the cutoff and repeatedly inspected 100 randomly selected articles. At the 2% quantile we saw no evidence of broken text.\n\nArticles with the following keywords in the article were discarded: Author Index, Key Word Index, Erratum, Editorial Board, Corrigendum, Announcement, Books received, Product news, and Business news (point 3). These keywords were found as part of the process of identifying acknowledgments and reference lists. Further, any article that was available through PubMed Central was preferentially selected by matching doi identifiers. This left a total of 14,549,483 full-text articles for further analysis.\n\nSome articles were not separable, or were subsets of others. For instance, conference proceedings may contain many individual articles in the same PDF. We found 1,911,365 articles in which this was the case. In these cases we removed the duplicates, or the shorter texts, but kept one copy for text mining. In total, we removed 898,048 duplicate text files.\n\nThe majority of articles had a separate abstract. We matched articles from PubMed Central to their respective MEDLINE abstract using the PMCID to PubMed ID conversion file available from PMC. Articles from Springer and Elsevier typically had a separate abstract in the meta-data. Any abstract from an article that was part of the 1,911,365 articles that could not be separated was removed. This led to a total of 10,376,626 abstracts for which the corresponding full text was also included downstream, facilitating a comparative analysis.\n\nReferences for the full text articles analyzed can be found at 10.6084/m9.figshare.5419300. An article is preferentially referenced by its Digital Object Identifier (DOI) (98.8%). However, if that was not available, we used the PubMed Central ID for PMC articles (0.005%), or the list of authors, article title, journal name, and year. (0.006%)\n\nText mining of articles\nWe performed text mining of the articles using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system, described earlier [30\u201333]. The software is open source and can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/larsjuhljensen/tagger. The NER approach is dictionary based, and thus depends on well-constructed dictionaries and stop word lists. We used the gene names from the STRING dictionary v10.0 [30], disease names from the Disease Ontology (DO) [34] and compartment names from the Gene Ontology branch cellular component [35]. Stop word lists were all created and maintained in-house. Pure NER based approaches often struggles with ambiguity of words. Therefore, we included additional dictionaries that we do not report the results from. If any identified term was found in multiple dictionaries, it was discarded due to ambiguity. The additional dictionaries include small molecule names from STITCH [36], tissue names from the Brenda Tissue Ontology [37], Gene Ontology biological process and molecular function [35], and the mammalian phenotype ontology [38]. The latter is a modified version made to avoid clashes with the disease ontology. The dictionaries can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5827494.\n\nIn the cases where the dictionary was constructed from an ontology co-occurrences were backtracked through all parents. E.g. the term type 1 diabetes mellitus from the Disease Ontology is backtracked to its parent, diabetes mellitus, then to glucose metabolism disease, etc.\n\nCo-occurrences were scored using the scoring system described in [39]. In short, a weighted count for each pair of entities (e.g. disease-gene) was calculated using the formula,\n\nwhere \u03b4 is an indicator function taking into account whether the terms i,j co-occur within the same document (d), paragraph (p), or sentence (s). w is the co-occurrence weight here set to 1.0, 2.0, and 0.2, respectively. Based on the weighted count, the score S(i,j) was calculated as,\nwhere \u03b1 is set to 0.6. All weights were optimized using the KEGG pathway maps as benchmark (described further below). The S scores were converted to Z scores, as described earlier [40].\n\nBenchmarking of associations\nPPIs were benchmarked using pathway maps from the KEGG database [41\u201343]. Any two proteins in the same pathway were set to be a positive example, and any two proteins present in at least one pathway, but not the same, were set as a negative example. This approach assumes that the pathways are near complete and includes all relevant proteins. The same approach has been used for the STRING database [39]. The disease\u2013gene benchmarking set was created by setting the disease-gene associations from UniProt [44] and Genetics Home Reference (https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed 23th March 2017) as positive examples. The positive examples were then shuffled, and the shuffled examples were set as negative examples. Shuffled examples that ended up overlapping with the positive examples were discarded. This approach has previously been described [31]. The protein\u2013compartment benchmark set was created by extracting the compartment information for each protein from UniProt and counting these as positive examples. For every protein found in at least one compartment, all compartments where it was not found were set as negative examples. The same approach has been used previously [33].\n\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were created by gradually increasing the Z-score and calculating the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), as described in eqs (3) and (4).\n\nWe compare the ROC curves by the Area Under the Curve (AUC), a metric ranging from 0 to 1. ROC-AUC curves provide a quantitative way of comparing benchmarks of classifiers, and is often used in machine learning and text mining. A perfect classifier will have an AUC = 1, and a classifier that performs equal to or worse than random will have an AUC \u2264 0.5.\n\nIndividual mentions of entities used for the benchmark in each article can be downloaded from 10.6084/m9.figshare.5620417.\n\nResults\nWe analyzed and compared four different corpora comprising all full-text articles (14,549,483 articles, All Full-texts), full-text articles that had a separate abstract (10,376,626 articles, Core Full-texts), the abstract from the full-text articles (10,376,626 abstracts, Core Abstracts), and the MEDLINE corpus (16,544,511 abstracts, MEDLINE) (see Methods for a detailed description of the pre-processing).\n\nGrowth and temporal development in full text corpora\nThe growth of the data set over time is of general interest in itself, however, it is also important to secure that the concepts used in the benchmarks are likely to be present in a large part of the corpus. We found that the number of full-text articles has grown exponentially over a long period (Fig 1A, a log-transformed version is provided in S2 Fig). We also observed that the growth represents a mixture of two components: one from 1823\u20131944, and another from 1945\u20132016. Through linear regression of the log2-transformed counts for the period 1945\u20132016 we found that the growth rate is 0.103 (p < 2 * 10\u221216, R2 = 0.95). Thus, the doubling time for the full-text corpus is 9.7 years. In comparison, MEDLINE had a growth rate of 0.195 (p < 2 * 10\u221216, R2 = 0.91) and a doubling time of 5.1 years. We noticed that there was a drop in the number of full-text publications around the years 1914\u20131918 and 1940\u20131945. Likewise, we see a decrease in the number of publications indexed by MEDLINE in the entire period 1930\u20131948.\n\nIn the full-text corpora we found a total of 12,781 unique journal titles. The most prevalent journals are tied to health or life sciences, such as The Lancet, Tetrahedron Letters, and Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, or the more broad journals such as PLoS ONE (see S1 Table for the top-15 journals). The Lancet publishes only very few articles per issue, it was established in 1823 and has been active in publishing since then, thus explaining why it so far has nearly published 400,000 articles. In contrast, PLoS ONE was launched in 2006, and has published more than 172,000 articles. Of the 12,781 journal titles, 6,900 had one or more category labels assigned by librarians at the Technical University of Denmark. The vast majority of the full-texts, 13,343,040, were published in journals with one or more category labels. The frequency of each category within the corpus can be seen in S1 Fig. We observed that before the 1950\u2019s health science dominated and made up almost 75% of all publications (Fig 1B). At the start of the 1950\u2019s the fraction started to decrease, and to date health science makes up approximately 25% of all publications in the full-text corpus. Inspecting the remaining eleven categories in a separate plot we found that there was no single category that was responsible for the growth (S3 Fig).\n\nWe binned the full-text articles into four categories based on the number of pages (see Methods). The average length of articles has increased considerably during the almost 250 years studied (Fig 1C). Whereas 75% of the articles were 1\u20133 pages long at the end of the 20th century, less than 25% of the articles published after year 2000 are that short. Conversely, articles with ten or more pages only made up between 0.7%-7% in the 19th century, a level that had grown to 20% by the start of the 21st century. We also observed that the average number of mentioned entities changed over time (S4 Fig). Mentions of genes and compartments were nearly non-existing prior to 1950, and has been increasing at an exponential rate since year 2000. Moreover, disease mentions dropped around year 1950, which correlates well with the decreasing proportion of published articles from health science journals in our corpus (Fig 1C).\n\nEvaluating information extraction across corpora\nWe ran the textmining pipeline on the two full-text and two abstract corpora. In all cases we found that the AUC-value was far greater than 0.5, from which we conclude that the results were substantially better than random (Fig 2) (see Methods for a definition of the AUC). The biggest gain in performance when using full-text was seen in finding associations between diseases and genes (AUC increase from 0.85 to 0.91) (Table 1). Compared to MEDLINE, the traditional corpus used for biomedical text mining, there was an increase in the AUC from 0.85 to 0.91. The smallest gain was associations between proteins, which increased from 0.70 to 0.73. Likewise, the Core Full-texts always performed better than Core Abstracts, signifying that some associations are only reported in the main body of the text. Consequently, traditional text mining of abstracts will never be able to find this information. All Z-scores used for benchmarking can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5340514.\n\nIt has previously been speculated if text mining of full-text articles may be more difficult and lead to an increased rate of false positives [3]. To investigate this we altered the weights of the scoring system (See Methods, Eqs 1 and 2). The scoring scheme used here has weights for within sentence, within paragraph and within document co-occurrences (see Methods). When setting the document weight to zero versus using the previously calibrated value found in an earlier study we found that having a non-zero small value does indeed improve extraction of known facts in all cases (S5 Fig) [33]. We observed that the increase in AUC is less than when using a lower document weight (S2 Table). In one case, protein\u2013protein associations, the MEDLINE abstract corpus outperforms the full-text articles. Abstracts are generally unaffected by the document weight, mainly because abstracts are almost always one paragraph. Overall, the difference in performance gain is largest for full-texts and lowest for abstracts and MEDLINE. Hence, all the full-text information is indeed valuable and necessary.\n\nFor practical applications, it is often necessary to have a low False Positive Rate (FPR). Accordingly, we evaluated the True Positive Rate (TPR) of the different corpora at the 10% FPR (TPR@10%FPR) (Fig 3). We found that full-texts have the highest TPR@10%FPR for disease-gene associations (S2 Table). When considering protein\u2013protein associations and protein-compartment associations, full-texts perform equivalently to Core Abstracts and Core Full-texts. The result was similar to when we evaluated the AUC across the full range, removing the document weight has the biggest impact on the full-texts (S5 Fig and S6 Fig), while abstracts remain unaffected.\n\nDiscussion\nWe have investigated a unique corpus consisting of 15 million full-text articles and compared the results to the most commonly used corpus for biomedical text mining, MEDLINE. We found that the full-text corpus outperforms the MEDLINE abstracts in all benchmarked cases, with the exception of TPR@10%FDR for protein\u2013compartment associations. To our knowledge, this is the largest comparative study to date of abstracts and full-text articles. We envision that the results presented here can be used in future applications for discovering novel associations from mining of full-text articles, and as a motivation to always include full-text articles when available and to improve the techniques used for this purpose.\n\nThe corpus consisted of 15,032,496 full-text documents, mainly in PDF format. 1,504,674 documents had to be discarded for technical reasons, primarily because they were not in English. Further, a large number of documents were also found to be duplicates or subsets of each other. On manual inspection we found that these were often conference proceedings, collections of articles etc., which were not easily separable without manual curation. We also managed to identify the list of references in the majority of the articles thereby reducing some repetition of knowledge that could otherwise lead to an increase in the false positive rate.\n\nWe have encountered and described a number of problems when working with full-text articles converted from PDF to TXT from a large corpus. However, the majority of the problems did not stem from the PDF to TXT conversion, which could potentially be solved using a layout aware conversion tool. Examples include PDFX [25], SectLabel [26] and LA-PDFText [27] of which the first is not practical for very large corpora as it only exists as an online tool. Nonetheless, to make use of the large volume of existing articles it is necessary to solve these problems. Having all the articles in a structured XML format, such as the one provided by PubMed Central, would with no doubt produce a higher quality corpus. This may in turn further increase the benchmark results for full-text articles. Nevertheless, the reality is that many articles are not served that way. Consequently, the performance gain we report here should be viewed as a lower limit as we have sacrificed quality in favor of a larger volume of articles. The solutions we have outlined here will serve as a guideline and baseline for future studies.\n\nThe increasing article length may have different underlying causes, but one of the main contributors is most likely increased funding to science worldwide [45,46]. Experiments and protocols are consequently getting increasingly complex and interdisciplinary\u2013aspects that also contribute to driving meaningful publication lengths upward. The increased complexity has also been found to affect the language of the articles, as it is becoming more specialized[47]. Moreover, we observed a steep increase in the average number of mentions of genes and compartments. This finding can most likely be attributed to recent developments in molecular biology, such as the sequencing of the human genome, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and other high-throughput technologies in \u2018omics [48,49]. It was outside the scope of this paper to go further into socio-economic impact. We have limited this to presenting the trends from what could be computed from the meta-data.\n\nPrevious papers are\u2013in terms of benchmarking\u2013only making qualitative statements about the value of full-text articles as compared to text in abstracts. In one paper a single statement is made on the potential for extracting information, but no quantitative evidence is presented [50]. In a paper targeting pharmacogenomics it is similarly stated that that there are associations that only are found in the full-text, but no quantitative estimates are presented [20]. In a paper analyzing around 20,000 full-text papers a search for physical protein interactions was made, concluding that these contain considerable higher levels of interaction [19]. Again, no quantitative benchmarks were made comparing different sources. In this paper, we have made a detailed comparison of four different corpora that provides a strong basis for estimating the added value of using full-text articles in text mining workflows.\n\nWe have used quite difficult, but still well established benchmarks, to illustrate the differences in performance when comparing text mining of abstracts to full-text articles. Within biology, and specifically in the area of systems biology, macromolecular interactions and the relationships between genes, tissues and diseases are key data that drive modeling and the analysis of causal biochemical mechanisms. Knowledge of interactions between proteins is extremely useful when revealing the components, which contribute to mechanisms in both health and disease. As many biological species from evolution share protein orthologs, their mutual interactions can often be transferred, for example from an experiment in another organism to the corresponding pair of human proteins where the experiment has not yet been performed. Such correspondences can typically be revealed by text mining as researchers in one area often will not follow the literature in the other and vice versa.\n\nThe results presented here are purely associational. Through rigorous benchmarking and comparison of a variety of biologically relevant associations, we have demonstrated that a substantial amount of relevant information is only found in the full body of text. Additionally, by modifying the document weight we found that it was important to take into account the whole document and not just individual paragraphs. The improvement in AUC that we present here were not overwhelming. One reason could be that associations have a higher probability of being curated if they are mentioned in the abstract. Moreover, most tools are geared towards abstracts. Thus, what we present is a lower limit on the performance gain. Consequently, as more full-text articles become available and text-mining methods improve, the quantitative benchmarks will improve. However, because the literature is highly redundant diminishing returns in terms of performance gain should be expected when adding evermore text. Event-based text mining will be the next step for a deeper interpretation and extending the applicability of the results [5]. With more development it may also be possible to extract quantitative values, as has been demonstrated for pharmacokinetics [51]. Other work is also going into describing the similarity between terms, and how full-text articles can augment this [52]. However, this is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nThe Named Entity Recognition (NER) system used depends heavily on the dic",
    "\nThe  primary  role  of   most  Western  media  during  the  period  between  the  11 \nSeptember  attacks  and  those  in  London  almost  four  years  later  has  been  to \nprovide definitions: what it is to be of one nationality or another; what it is to be \ndemocratic; what it is to be Muslim; what it is to be a suicide bomber; what it is \nto be \u2018hate-filled\u2019. Without these characteristics, the \u2018war on terror\u2019 would have \nno shape. To  meet  this  formidable  challenge  required  the  media  was  itself   to  be \nextremely well informed. Not only would it have to accurately identify the source \nand purpose of  the terrorist threat, but also accurately describe the nations that \nwere being threatened. Why do they hate us? It was a question the media had to \nbe able to answer accurately and without hesitation. In these endeavours most media has completely failed. In fact, most have never \nsought to provide such a service to the public.\n\u2018Why do they hate us?\u2019 In the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on New  York  and \nWashington,  this  was  a  question  that  many  Americans  asked  themselves,  each  other, \nand anybody who was prepared to listen. The question has brought a range of  answers. \nSome  are  as  simple  as:  \u2018Because  we  give  them  lots  of   reasons  to  do  so.\u2019  Equally,  the \nanswer could be: \u2018Because they hate each other and possibly even themselves. But they \nare looking for somebody else to blame for their woes.\u2019 Whatever the answer, since that \nday when the United States found itself  forced to face the consequences of  its foreign \npolicy choices, the difficulty its people, its thinkers, and its policymakers have had in \nunderstanding what is confronting them has grown rather than diminished. Far from being contained or consigned to the margins as a \u2018radical minority\u2019 or an \n\u2018extremist fringe\u2019 or a group that \u2018hates our success and prosperity\u2019, the suicide bombers, \nextremist  preachers,  and  radicalized  groups  that  together  amount  to  the  \u2018global  jihad\u2019 \nare  presenting  a  challenge  that  is  likely  to  prove  as  profound  and  enduring  as  any  in \nhistory.\n  \u2018Why do they hate us?\u2019 was once the plaintive cry of a people that reckoned the \ntrauma would eventually pass. National strategies would and could be put in place to \ndeal with the consequences. Life would return to normal. The survival of  the nation \nwas \u2013 ultimately \u2013 not at stake. But to convince themselves that there was no mortal \nthreat  to  a  way  of   life  whose  value  ultimately  lies  in  the  opportunity  to  take  it  for \ngranted, Americans cocooned themselves in a web of  lies, deceits, and misinformation \nabout themselves and their place in the world. Meanwhile,  on  the  other  side  of   the  Atlantic  Ocean,  the  opposite  appeared  to  be \ntrue. In Britain the assumption since 11 September had been that one day the counter-\nterrorism effort would fail and that the bombers would slip through the net and commit \ntheir crimes. The British knew they would be attacked, and prepared themselves. That it took until 7 July 2005 for the attackers to achieve their aims \u2013 after numerous \nplots  aimed  at  Britain  had  been  foiled  \u2013  provided  ample  opportunity  for  the  British \nto  examine  their  national  psyche.  They  talked  of   their  sang-froid,  their  stoicism,  and \nreferred to the qualities that had seen them through IRA terrorism during the 1970s and \n1980s. But not only were the British rumoured to be made of  sterner stuff  than their \nAmerican allies; they also seemed to have the courage to admit that whatever measures \nwere  taken  to  thwart  a  plot,  it  was  bound  to  happen  sooner  or  later.  Empowered  by \ntheir realism, the British embarked on the process of  waiting \u2013 a process that ended \nwith the 7 July bombings in London. Against this background, the primary role of  most media in both countries during \nthe period between the 11 September attacks and those in London almost four years \nlater was to provide definitions: what it is to be American or British; what it is to be \ndemocratic; what it is to be Muslim; what it is to be a suicide bomber; what it is to be \n\u2018hate-filled\u2019. The media has facilitated the process of defining what the people involved \nin this drama are: some people are terrorists; some people are intelligence officers; some \npeople  are  apologists  while  others  are  either  moderates  or  extremists;  some  people \nare senior al-Qaeda operatives, while other people are foot-soldiers; some people are \nvictims; other people are Western allies, while some are \u2018not with us, so they are against \nus\u2019. For the media, as for the political establishment with which its agenda is so closely \nentwined,  everybody  has  had  to  become  something.  Without  allotted  roles,  the  \u2018war \non terror\u2019 would have no shape. A shape was needed in order for bulletins and news \nreports  to  have  a  beginning,  a  middle,  and  an  end,  for  headline  writers  to  grab  the \nreaders\u2019 attention for yet more of  the same story, and for nations to feel that they were \nwinning, that the \u2018war\u2019 was moving, and that all this would one day come to an end so \nthat we could all get back to living normal lives. Just  as  the  people  of   America  wrapped  themselves  in  the  Stars  and  Stripes,  so \nthe  British  sought  to  prove  their  sang-froid  was  not  a  hackneyed  clich\u00e9  but  a  national \ncharacteristic with real substance. But to really believe this of  themselves they required \nthe media. Unless the media flew the flag, the people would not know how to respond \nto the threat to the nation. Thus, the media had the role of defining the nation of which \nthe people under threat needed to feel a part. The media would define who was a part \nof  the nation and who was not. Those who were a part were the heroes; those who were \nnot  could  be  rightly  reviled.  In  short,  the  media  would  become  the  window  through \nwhich the people would see the correct version of  themselves and their enemy. To meet this formidable challenge required that the media was itself  extremely well \ninformed. Not only would it have to accurately identify the source and purpose of  the \nterrorist threat, but also describe the nations that were being threatened. Why do they \nhate us? It was a question the media had to be able to answer accurately and without \nhesitation, because to explain why a bomb had been detonated or a person shot or a plot revealed, the media had to be able to provide context, historical perspective, and  genuine, well-judged, well-informed, and sober explanation. \n\n\n\n",
    "Why a Covid booster dose is crucial against the omicron variant\nPublished Tue, Dec 14 20216:32 AM ESTUpdated 3 Hours Ago\nKey Points\nGovernments around the world are desperately trying to deploy Covid booster shots to millions of people in order to bolster their protection against the more transmissible variant.\nPreliminary studies have found that omicron reduces the efficacy of two-dose Covid vaccines, but a booster shot can restore a significant level of protection.\nIt\u2019s been less than a month since the new, heavily mputated Covid strain was detected and designated a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d by the World Health Organization. It\u2019s now spreading rapidly.\nU.S. President Joe Biden receives his coronavirus disease (COVID-19) booster vaccination in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building's South Court Auditorium at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 27, 2021.\nAs the specter of omicron looms large over the festive season, governments around the world are desperately trying to deploy Covid-19 booster shots in order to bolster people\u2019s protection against the more transmissible variant.\n\nIt\u2019s been less than a month since the new, heavily mutated Covid omicron strain was detected and designated a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d by the World Health Organization. Before this, studies had shown that the immunity provided by Covid vaccines waned after around six months \u2014 meaning that booster shots are essential to increasing protective antibodies to fight a potential infection.\n\nCDC definition of fully vaccinated could include Covid boosters by January, says Dr. Patel\nThe emergence of omicron has made booster shots even more important. This is because a number of early studies \u2014 which have been published prior to peer review due to the urgency of the situation \u2014 have shown that Covid vaccines are less effective against the omicron variant compared with the globally dominant delta strain and other variants.\n\nBut the same studies have indicated that three vaccine doses \u2014 the two preliminary shots plus a booster \u2014 significantly increase the level of protection against omicron.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of the studies released to date, and what they have found:\n\nInitial findings from South Africa\nLast Tuesday, scientists in South Africa, where omicron was first detected, said their small preliminary study into the variant had found that it significantly reduces the antibody protection generated by Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine. However, it found that people who had recovered from the virus and received a booster shot would likely have more protection from severe disease.\n\nThe scientists concluded that \u201cprevious infection, followed by vaccination \u2013 or likely a booster \u2013 is probably protective against omicron, and almost certainly against severe disease.\u201d\n\nPfizer-BioNTech\u2019s results\nThen, last Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech published their own initial lab results testing the omicron variant against their shot, which also showed a significant reduction in the two-dose vaccine\u2019s ability to fight omicron. However, the companies found that a booster dose offered significant protection against the variant and noted that the initial two doses may still protect against severe disease.\n\nUK\u2019s Health Security Agency\nThe U.K.\u2019s Health Security Agency published a report last Friday, citing initial findings from a real-world study, that said a two-dose course of Covid vaccines were significantly less effective against the omicron variant than the delta strain. However, it found that a \u201cmoderate to high vaccine effectiveness of 70 to 75% is seen in the early period after a booster dose.\u201d\n\nThe booster dosage that was assessed was the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, with participants in the study having their first two doses of either the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine or Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s.\n\nHowever, the UKHSA cautioned that it will be a few weeks before effectiveness against severe disease with omicron will be known, adding that \u201cthe duration of restored protection after mRNA boosting is not known at this juncture.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s and Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s shots are mRNA \u2014 or messenger RNA \u2014 vaccines which teach our cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response in our bodies. This response then produces antibodies that help to protect people against Covid infection.\n\nResearch from Israel\nMore research emerged from Israel on Saturday, with researchers also finding that a three-shot course of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine provided significant protection against omicron.\n\nThe study, carried out by Sheba Medical Center and the Health Ministry\u2019s Central Virology Laboratory, compared the blood of 20 people who had received two vaccine doses five to six months earlier to the same number of individuals who had received a booster one month before.\n\n\u201cPeople who received the second dose 5 or 6 months ago do not have any neutralization ability against the omicron. While they do have some against the delta [strain],\u201d Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the infectious diseases unit at Sheba, said, according to a Reuters report at the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that with the booster dose it increases about a hundredfold. There is a significant protection of the booster dose. It is lower than the neutralization ability against the delta, about four times lower,\u201d she said.\n\nUniversity of Oxford study\nThe latest study to bolster our understanding about omicron\u2019s impact on vaccines came from the U.K. on Monday where, again, scientists from the University of Oxford also found that two doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines were substantially less effective at warding off omicron compared with previous variants of the virus.\n\nResearchers tested blood samples of people 28 days after their second dose of either vaccine. When omicron was introduced to those samples, scientists reported \u201ca substantial fall\u201d in the neutralizing antibodies that fight off Covid.\n\nWhile a booster shot\u2019s effectiveness against severe infection has not yet been confirmed, the numbers of omicron cases in Europe, the U.S. and southern Africa where it was first detected are increasing fast.\n\nEarly studies and anecdotal evidence suggests that while omicron is more transmissible, it causes a less severe infection. There was further evidence that two doses of a Covid vaccine \u2014 which have already been proven to greatly reduce the risk of severe infection, hospitalization and death when confronted with previous Covid variants \u2014 do help to reduce the risk of hospitalizations with omicron infections.\n\nOn Tuesday, a major real-world study from South Africa suggested that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offered 70% protection against hospitalization during the recent surge of cases in the country, and 33% protection against infection, Reuters reported. Researchers conducting the study cautioned that its findings should be considered preliminary.\n\nBooster rush\nNow the race is on for governments to supply their populations with vaccine boosters. Officials in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere are urging people to get jabbed ahead of the holiday season.\n\nIt comes as omicron sparks a surge in Covid cases. British scientists have estimated that omicron cases are doubling every two to three days and said the country should brace itself for a million cases by the end of the year.\n\nThe omicron variant now accounts for at least 20% of confirmed cases in England and U.K. Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned that the new variant accounts for 44% of cases in London and is expected to become the dominant variant in the capital over the next 48 hours.\n\nLengthy queues were seen around the U.K. as people lined up to secure their booster jab, while the country\u2019s vaccine booking website crashed on Monday amid a surge in demand.",
    "Surging US producer prices add to pressure on Fed to accelerate taper\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to announce it will scale back its asset purchase programme more quickly, a pivot for which chair Jay Powell has signalled support \u00a9 AFP via Getty Images\n\nWe\u2019ll send you a myFT Daily Digest email rounding up the latest US Inflation news every morning.\n\nUS producer prices rose at the fastest pace on record in November, piling additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to more swiftly dial down the emergency policy settings it put in place during the pandemic in order to tame surging inflation.\n\nThe producer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday jumped 0.8 per cent in November, for an annual increase of 9.6 per cent. That is the fastest year-over-year rate since the data were first collected in 2010.\n\n\u201cCore\u201d producer prices also minted new records. After stripping out volatile items such as food and energy, prices rose 6.9 per cent from the previous year, the biggest advance since August 2014, when the BLS first began its calculations.\n\nThe report comes at the start of a two-day meeting for the US central bank, which is actively debating how to adjust the amount of stimulus it is providing to an economy that is currently experiencing the highest inflation in almost 40 years.\n\nThe Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday it will scale back its asset purchase programme more quickly, doubling the pace it set just a month ago. The aim is to bring an end to the bond-buying programme several months earlier in order to give the Fed the flexibility to raise interest rates sooner.\n\nChair Jay Powell set the stage for this pivot several weeks ago when he signalled his support for an earlier exit in the face of what he said were mounting risks that inflation could become a more persistent problem.\n\nOnce concentrated to a few sectors most sensitive to pandemic-related reopenings and supply-chain disruptions, such as used cars and travel-related expenses, consumer price inflation has shown clear signs of broadening out.\n\nThe BLS noted that last month\u2019s increase in producer prices was also \u201cbroad-based\u201d, with expenses related to services, transportation and warehousing moving higher. Prices for iron and steel scrap, as well as gasoline and food items rose as well.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday is also expected to signal multiple interest rate increases next year, with further adjustments pencilled in for subsequent years. In September, the last time the so-called \u201cdot plot\u201d of individual interest rate projections was published, Fed officials were evenly split on whether lift-off from today\u2019s near-zero levels would occur in 2022.\n\nNow, economists anticipate the dot plot to show two rate rises in 2022, followed by three or four subsequent moves in 2023 and again in 2024.\n\nModerate Democrats are pushing the Fed to do more to contain inflation, which has been politically toxic for the Biden administration as it seeks to pass its $1.75tn Build Back Better spending legislation.\n\nRepublicans and some members of the president\u2019s party have resisted the spending package, which comes on the heels of another $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure bill, citing the increase in prices and the painful costs imposed on Americans by inflation.\n\nWhite House officials, like most economists, expect inflation to moderate next year, but there is significant uncertainty about when exactly this will begin.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are going to be pretty strong for at least the next six months, so it means the rhetoric around inflation is going to continue to mount until the peaking occurs late in the first quarter or second quarter,\u201d said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS and a former Fed staffer. \u201cThis is all just going to build for the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nTraders on Tuesday shifted their bets following the inflation report, pricing in just under three quarter-point rate rises next year, based on Fed funds futures. Those trades fell just short of a late November peak for expectations of how quickly the Fed would lift rates next year, before the Omicron coronavirus variant rattled markets.\n\nTreasuries sold off, pushing yields on both the two- and 10-year notes up. The selling most acutely hit longer tenors, with the 10-year yield rising 0.04 percentage points to 1.46 per cent. Yields move inversely to a bond\u2019s price.\n\nThe potential for more hawkish policy from the US central bank also weighed on the country\u2019s $53tn stock market, with the benchmark S&P 500 sliding further from a record closing high struck on Friday.",
    "Spider-Man: No Way Home' set to dominate domestic box office, nab highest opening of the pandemic\nKey Points\nConservative estimates suggest \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d will top the $100 million mark over its three-day debut, but co-producer Sony projects a tally closer to $130 million.\nMore optimistic box office analysts suggest that the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe film could top $200 million.\nThe latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the most anticipated films of the year and fans who are eager to avoid spoilers will likely arrive in droves to cinemas this weekend.\nTom Holland stars as Peter Parker in Marvel's \"Spider-Man: No Way Home.\"\n\nDisney\nThe domestic box office may have finally found a hero.\n\nMarvel\u2019s friendly neighborhood Spider-Man swings into theaters once more this weekend and promises to deliver big gains for the movie theater industry. Conservative estimates suggest \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\u201d Tom Holland\u2019s third solo run as the iconic webslinger, will top the $100 million mark over its three-day debut, but co-producer Sony projects the film will tally closer to $130 million.\n\n\u2033\u2018Spider-Man: No Way Home\u2019 isn\u2019t just the most anticipated movie of the holiday season, it\u2019s the most anticipated movie of the year,\u201d said Jeff Bock, senior analyst at Exhibitor Relations. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen from countless other superhero flicks in 2021, audiences will not only break the box office opening weekend, but have legs for months.\u201d\n\n\u2033$100 million is a done deal. $150 million may be within its grasp,\u201d Bock said.\n\nAny figure over $100 million would be a milestone for the pandemic era, as the current record holder for highest opening is the $90 million haul Sony\u2019s \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d pulled in back in October.\n\nHolland\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d secured $117 million during its three-day opening in 2017 and \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d stuck a $92 million landing in 2019, according to data from Comscore. Currently, the highest-grossing Spider-Man flick is 2007\u2032s \u201cSpider-Man 3\u201d featuring Tobey McGuire in the titular role.\n\nMore optimistic box office analysts suggest that the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe film could top $200 million. Of course, the pandemic box office has been incredibly difficult to predict and indicators, like advanced ticket sales, have not been as accurate in determining an opening weekend haul as they were in previous years.\n\nThe domestic box office has rebounded from historic lows in 2020, but has yet to reach the same levels seen prior to the pandemic. While many movie theaters have instituted mask mandates, not all audiences have felt comfortable returning to cinemas. Films aimed at older audiences like \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d \u201cHouse of Gucci,\u201d \u201cThe Last Duel\u201d and \u201cWest Side Story\u201d have not been able to draw in moviegoers.\n\nFranchise films, on the other hand, have been a major draw for audiences \u2014 particularly those that target the 18- to 40-year-old demographic.\n\nKicked off by \u201cF9\u201d and \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d the domestic box office has made gains in 2021 and there is hope that 2022 will continue those trends with films like \u201cThe Batman,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 2,\u201d \u201cDoctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness,\u201d and \u201cJurassic World: Dominion.\u201d\n\nThe MCU has a solid track record at the box office and lands in a demographic sweet spot, continuing to entice younger audience members to head to cinemas as well as other generations who have been keeping up with the franchise for over a decade.\n\nAdd in a charismatic Holland in the lead role and months of conjecture about which characters might appear in the film and \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d has a perfect storm of factors that could lead it the highest box office gains of the pandemic era.\n\n\u2033\u2018No Way Home\u2019 has already captured the cultural zeitgeist and it isn\u2019t even out yet,\u201d said Shawn Robbins, chief media analyst at BoxOffice.com. \u201cFilms like that are a rare breed because they drive intense enthusiasm and rampant speculation for months, and sometimes years.\u201d\n\nLike 2019\u2032s \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d fans will likely arrive in droves to movie theaters this weekend to see the film in order to avoid spoilers.\n\n\u201cThe film is promising gigantic stakes and a very unique hook that could forever change the course of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,\u201d Robbins said.",
    "Stocks fall ahead of key Fed decision, Nasdaq drops 1.1% as software names slide\nPublished Mon, Dec 13 20216:05 PM ESTUpdated Moments Ago\n\nMarkets set to open lower as inflation data, Fed meeting loom\nU.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as some large tech stocks moved lower and new inflation data continued to show a sharp rise in prices.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite led the decline, falling 1.14% to 15,237.64. The S&P 500 slid 0.75% to close at 4,634.09. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better than its counterparts but still fell 106.77 points, or 0.30%, to 35,544.18.\n\nTech stocks were a main source of weakness on Tuesday, though the sector trimmed its losses in afternoon trading. Microsoft was a major drag on the market averages, falling 3.2%. Fellow software stock Adobe dropped 6.6%.\n\nElsewhere, automaker Ford slid nearly 1.9% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space in which Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Tesla shares fell 0.8% after filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that CEO Elon Musk sold another $906.5 million in shares.\n\nShares of Netflix, Apple and Amazon all ended the session in negative territory as well.\n\n\u201cThe large cap names are now starting to fall by the wayside, which is exactly what happened in 2018, the last time we had sort of that rolling correction idea,\u201d Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cHalftime Report.\u201d\n\nThe down day on Wall Street followed the November reading for the producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record and above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.\n\nThe hotter-than-expected inflation reading comes as the Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.\n\nInvestors will be watching closely this week for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank\u2019s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.\n\nThe latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.\n\nWolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients on Tuesday that the Fed will need to walk a fine line to avoid spooking the markets.\n\n\u201cFed Chair Powell has a very difficult communication job ahead of him tomorrow afternoon. We\u2019re in line with consensus and expect the Fed to end its tapering program in March/April and start hiking in May,\u201d the note said. \u201cIf Fed Chair Powell emphasizes that the FOMC remains flexible, the \u2018Fed put\u2019 should remain in place. However, if his tone is overly hawkish, it could turn into a disaster like December 2018.\u201d\n\nOn the positive side for the market, major bank stocks rose along with interest rates, with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America each adding more than 1%. Regional banks also outperformed.\n\nOn the Covid front, Pfizer announced that its drug aimed at treating patients with the virus proved effective in a final analysis, including against the new omicron variant. However, the World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that the new variant appeared to be spreading faster than previous versions of the virus.\n\nTuesday\u2019s moves marked a second straight down day for Wall Street. However, the Dow and S&P 500 are still within roughly 3% of their intraday record highs. The Nasdaq is about 6% below its high-water mark.\n",
    "James Webb telescope lifted atop its launch rocket\n\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been hoisted atop the rocket that will blast it into orbit.\n\nWeighing more than six tonnes, the $10bn successor to the legendary Hubble observatory was lifted by a crane and edged into position using guide lasers.\n\nWebb is the single most expensive space science experiment ever conceived.\n\nIts huge mirror and super-sensitive instruments will try to spy the first stars to shine in the Universe more than 13.5 billion years ago.\n\nOther work will see it probe the atmospheres of distant planets to look for signs of life.\n\nThe pictures on this page are among the last we will see of Webb on Earth.\n\nLift-off remains on schedule for Wednesday 22 December at 12:20 GMT.\n\nJWST is a US space agency (Nasa) venture, but the task of launching it has been given to the European Space Agency (Esa), which is a partner on the project along with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).\n\nEsa is using the dependable Ariane-5 for the job. The vehicle operates out of the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana.\n\nEngineers at the spaceport have been preparing the telescope and rocket in parallel and only brought them together into the same building last week.\n\nThe crane manoeuvres required to mate the pair required millimetric precision. A \"shower curtain\" was put around Webb during the work of attachment to keep the observatory and its mirrors super-clean.\n\nNot shown on this page is the activity of encapsulation - the placement of Ariane's nosecone, or fairing, over the top of Webb. This activity was scheduled to be completed on Tuesday.\n\nThe fairing, which will protect Webb during the first three minutes of its ascent to space, only just fits around the telescope.\n\nWebb, in its folded launch configuration, is a rectangular box measuring 10.6m (35ft) by 4.5m by 4.5m. This leaves a mere 15-20cm gap to the inner surface of the nosecone. And under launch loads, when everything is vibrating, this separation will be reduced still further to as little as 9cm.\n\nArianespace, the company in French Guiana that oversees Ariane launches, expects to roll the rocket out to the launch pad on Monday.\n\nWebb will continue to be monitored ahead of lift-off.\n\nThere are access points in the fairing, explains Esa Webb project manager Peter Rummel.\n\n\"This means we can purge the inside using very dry, super-clean air. We can also put in sensors to look for any contamination. And of course we switch on the telescope to check everything continues to be OK,\" he told BBC News.\n\nThe Ariane carries a number of modifications for the upcoming flight. In particular, special vents have been put in the sides of the fairing to ensure there is an even loss of pressure during the climb to orbit. This will ensure there is no abrupt change in environment that might damage the telescope when the fairing is discarded.\n\nThe rocket will throw Webb on to a path that will take it to an observing station some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth.\n\nThis journey should last a month, during which time Webb's 6.5m-diameter primary mirror and tennis court-sized sunshield will be unfolded.\n\nThe telescope has been designed to image the earliest objects to form after the Big Bang.\n\nThese are theorised to be colossal stars, grouping together in the first galaxies.\n\n\"There's speculation that these massive early stars might quickly collapse into black holes,\" explains Prof Andy Bunker from Oxford University.\n\n\"More massive stars will undergo rapid core collapse, which we call a supernova event. We see those as stellar explosions. But there is a sweet spot in terms of stellar mass where the star might collapse directly to a black hole. So-called direct-collapse black holes have been predicted but never seen observationally. Webb may give us the evidence, albeit indirectly.\"",
    "The Fourth of July is the United States' celebration of its independence from England. It is the day when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the new country's forefathers, and is a national holiday. It has been celebrated every year since 1776. Americans hold this day as one of the most revered holidays in the country.\n\nIndependence Day celebrations include firework shows that are held by various organizations throughout the country. The shows are held at stadiums, recreational parks, and private homes. Additionally, many businesses have giveaways and special discounts for all residents on this day. The firework shows are best at stadiums, where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks from vendors who sell their goods in supermarket parking lots.\n\n\nThe reason many cities no longer allow the sales, or use of fireworks is because of the fire hazards they pose. This is why the large, professional celebrations stadiums and parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still celebrate at home though. There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.\n\nAnother Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great meaning to most Americans.",
    "Perhaps the most obvious way artistic creation reflects how people live is by mirroring theenvironment \u2014 the materials and technologies available to a culture. Stone, wood, tree bark, clay,and sand are generally available materials. In addition, depending on the locality, other resourcesmay be accessible: shells, horns, gold, copper, and silver. The different uses to which societies putthese materials are of interest to anthropologists who may ask, for example, why people chooseto use clay and not copper when both items are available. Although there are no conclusiveanswers yet, the way in which a society views its environment is sometimes apparent in its choiceand use of artistic materials. The use of certain metals, for example, may be reserved forceremonial objects of special importance. Or the belief in the supernatural powers of a stone ortree may cause a sculptor to be sensitive to that material.\n\n\u3000\u3000What is particularly meaningful to anthropologist is the realization that although thematerials available to a society may to some extent limit or influence what it can do artistically,the materials by no means determine what is done. Why do the artists in Japanese society rakesand into patterns; and the artists in Roman society melt sand to form glass? Moreover, evenwhen the same material is used in the same way by members of different societies, the form orstyle of the work varies enormously from culture to culture. A society may simply choose torepresent objects or phenomena that are important to its population. An examination of the artof the Middle Ages tells us something about the medieval preoccupation with theologicaldoctrine. In addition to revealing the primary concerns of a society, the content of that society'sart may also reflect the culture's social stratification.",
    "\u3000\u3000During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, almost nothing was written about the contributions of women during the colonial period and the early history of the newly formed United States. Lacking the right to vote and absent from the seats of power, women were not considered an important force in history. Anne Bradstreet wrote some significant poetry in the seventeenth century, Mercy Otis Warren produced the best contemporary history of the American Revolution, and Abigail Adams penned important letters showing she exercised great political influence over her husband, John, the second President of the United States. But little or no notice was taken of these contributions. During these centuries, women remained invisible in history books.\n\n\u3000\u3000Throughout the nineteenth century, this lack of visibility continued, despite the efforts of female authors writing about women. These writers, like most of their male counterparts, were amateur historians. Their writings were celebratory in nature, and they were uncritical in their selection and use of sources.\n\n\u3000\u3000During the nineteenth century, however, certain feminists showed a keen sense of history by keeping records of activities in which women were engaged. National, regional, and local women's organizations compiled accounts of their doings. Personal correspondence, newspaper clippings, and souvenirs were saved and stored. These sources from the core of the two greatest collections of women's history in the United States one at the Elizabeth and Arthur Schlesinger Library at Radcliff C\u00e9ol lege, and the other the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College. Such sources have provided valuable materials for later generations of historians.\n\n\u3000\u3000Despite the gathering of more information about ordinary women during the nineteenth century, most of the writing about women conformed to the great women theory of history, just as much of mainstream American history concentrated on great men. To demonstrate that women were making significant contributions to American life, female authors singled out women leaders and wrote biographies, or else important women produced their autobiographies. Most of these leaders were involved in public life as reformers, activists working for women's right to vote, or authors, and were not representative at all of the great of ordinary woman. The lives of ordinary people continued, generally, to be untold in the American histories being published.",
    "\u3000During most of their lives, surge glaciers behave like normal glaciers, traveling perhaps only a couple of inches per day. However, at intervals of 10 to 100 years, these glaciers move forward up to 100 times faster than usual. The surge often progresses along a glacier like a great wave, proceeding from one section to another. Subglacial streams of meltwater might act as a lubricant, allowing the glacier to flow rapidly toward the sea. The increasing water pressure under the glacier might lift it off its bed, overcoming the friction between ice and rock, thus freeing the glacier, which rapidly sliders downhill. Surge glaciers also might be influenced by the climate, volcanic heat, or earthquakes. However, many of these glaciers exist in the same area as normal glaciers, often almost side by side.\n\n\u3000\u3000Some 800 years ago, Alaska's Hubbard Glacier advanced toward the sea, retreated, and advanced again 500 years later. Since 1895, this seventy-mile-long river of ice has been flowing steadily toward the Gulf of Alaska at a rate of approximately 200 feet per year. In June 1986, however, the glacier surged ahead as much as 47 feet a day. Meanwhile, a western tributary, called Valerie Glacier, advanced up to 112 feet a day. Hubbard's surge closed off Russell Fiord with a formidable ice dam, some 2,500 feet wide and up to 800 feet high, whose caged waters threatened the town of Yakutat to the south.\n\n\u3000\u3000About 20 similar glaciers around the Gulf of Alaska are heading toward the sea. If enough surge glaciers reach the ocean and raise sea levels, west Antarctic ice shelves could rise off the seafloor and become adrift. A flood of ice would then surge into the Southern Sea. With the continued rise in sea level, more ice would plunge into the ocean, causing sea levels to rise even higher, which in turn would release more ice and set in motion a vicious cycle. The additional sea ice floating toward the tropics would increase Earth's albedo and lower global temperatures, perhaps enough to initiate a new ice age. This situation appears to have occurred at the end of the last warm interglacial (the time between glacations), called the Sangamon, when sea ice cooled the ocean dramatically, spawning the beginning of the Ice Age.",
    "\u3000By the turn of the century, the middle-class home in North American had been transformed. The flow of industry has passed and left idle the loom in the attic, the soap kettle in the shed, Ellen Richards wrote in 1908. The urban middle class was now able to buy a wide array of food products and clothing \u2014 baked goods, canned goods, suits, shirts, shoes, and dresses. Not only had household production waned, but technological improvements were rapidly changing the rest of domestic work. Middle-class homes had indoor running water and furnaces, run on oil, coal, or gas, that produced hot water. Stoves were fueled by gas, and delivery services provided ice for refrigerators. Electric power was available for lamps, sewing machines, irons, and even vacuum cleaners. No domestic task was unaffected. Commercial laundries, for instance, had been doing the wash for urban families for decades; by the early 1900's the first electric washing machines were on the market.\n\n\u3000\u3000One impact of the new household technology was to draw sharp dividing lines between women of different classes and regions. Technological advances always affected the homes of the wealthy first, filtering downward into the urban middle class. But women who lived on farms were not yet affected by household improvements. Throughout the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, rural homes lacked running water and electric power. Farm women had to haul large quantities of water into the house from wells or pumps for every purpose. Doing the family laundry, in large vats heated over stoves, continued to be a full day's work, just as canning and preserving continued to be seasonal necessities. Heat was provided by wood or coal stoves. In addition, rural women continued to produce most of their families' clothing. The urban poor, similarly, reaped few benefits from household improvements. Urban slums such as Chicago's nineteenth ward often had no sewers, garbage collection, or gas or electric lines; and tenements lacked both running water and central heating. At the turn of the century, variations in the nature of women's domestic work were probably more marked than at any time before.",
    "A large number of young people cannot find a job when they leave university. What problems will youth unemployment cause for individuals and for society? Give some measures to help reduce unemployment.\n\nA large number of young people can not find a job after leaving shool. what problems will youth unemployment cause for individuals and society? what measures should be taken to reduce the level of unemployment among young people?\n\nThe world is in for a worsening youth unemployment, with its causes resembling their consequences. It goes without saying that youth unemployment needs to be tackled urgently, but this important task is anything but easy. However, if the microeconomics theory is of any use at all, it must include explanations, but also solutions to such problems as are affecting school leavers as individuals and society as the labor market.\n\nIn a time of the economic recession, there is always a high jobless rate among young people, compared to the overall unemployment rate. This may explain in part why a large number of young people who are leaving school find it difficult to get a job. Particularly, youth unemployment spells a variety of hardships in a society that is powerless to create jobs. As unemployment balloons, competition among young individuals for jobs also rises, hence further pushing the society in general to tighten its belt, among other unpopular measures.\n\nUnfortunately, ways to create jobs for young people seem to be mostly slow and often ineffective, and worse still, widely divided as an economic issue. For instance, some governments decide to take austerity measures, contrary to the argument that to cut public spending in the presence of high unemployment would be to ignore the lessons of history that are specifically not in favor of young people looking for jobs. At another point, the expectation that private employers would be able to hire enough to bring youth unemployment down remains only an expectation and not a cure-all for graduate unemployment. Neither is entrepreneurship a promising option for graduate employment because the precarious character of working for oneself does not suit everybody.\n\nAll in all, those are challenges for individuals and the society as a whole in the light of the current economic recession in which young graduates are being severely affected. Accordingly, efforts from all sectors should lead to the assurance that the next decade would be one of growth and not of high unemployment. Here are the problems, and it seems that the last thing to do is to embrace nature's cure and wait them out.",
    "In many countries women are allowed to take maternity leave from their jobs during the first months after the birth of their baby. Does advantages outweigh disadvantages?\n\nIt is a customary practice for most countries in the world to give women a few months of maternity leave after they give birth to the baby. To spend a few months away from work after giving birth, however, has disadvantages as well as advantages.\nTo be sure, the newly-born baby is the one who benefits the most from the maternity leave. As we know, the first few months of the new life are always the most dangerous time, during which the baby faces many dangers, some quite unexpected, that may be deadly. Therefore, the concentrated and intensive care from the mother is critical for the survival of the baby. I have just read a newspaper report which compares the infant mortality rate between the countries which practice maternity leave and those which do not and concludes that infant death rate in the former is 25% lower than that in the latter. Besides, taking a few months off her work after the baby is born is also a good way to release the anxiety and stress the mother must have experienced during her pregnancy, so she will more likely behave normal after going back to work.\nLike anything else, maternity leave may also bring about some negative effects. In some female-dominated professions like nursing, the few months leave may cause a serious shortage of labor. And we have seen many women who simply cannot perform their job after the leave because they have totally forgotten how to do their job properly. Meanwhile, many women who used to be slender and beautiful have become fat and ugly after the few months of no work and over eating.\nTaking into account both the advantages and disadvantages, I believe maternity leave is a good thing. After all, the baby's survival and the mother's health are much more important than the possible side-effects of labor shortage, temporary forgetfulness of the work and physical ugliness. If the maternity leave time is wisely used, the new mothers may just as well return to their work as energetic and beautiful as before.",
    "In this chart, we can see the mobile phone subscriptions in developed countries have a steady and slight increase from 1990 to 2007 and then remain constant in 2008. Meanwhile the mobile phone subscriptions in developing countries have witnessed a slow increase from 1990 to 2004 and then a great surge from 2004 to 2007: the biggest surge happens from 2005 to 2006.\n\nThis chart reflects different developing modes of mobile phone industry in developed and developing countries. The developed countries have a limited number of populations, most of whom are well-educated.\n\nTherefore, the spreading of the mobile phone service is efficient and soon the market is saturated. On the other hand, at the top of the list is the recent huge improvement of the people's living standards in developing countries. It is reported that, with the rapid economic growth of these countries, mobile phone has become a life necessity rather than a luxury.\n\nMoreover, we must admit that the developing countries has a far more larger population and accordingly a larger demand for mobile services than developed countries.\n\nAs discussed above, it is not surprising to see this difference. And I firmly believe that this established trend will continue for quite a while in the forthcoming years."

(Rachel gives him the card.)\n\nRachel: Dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) What do you bet?\n\nRoss: I bet two dollars. (throws it in)\n\nRachel: OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. (throws it in)\n\nRoss: I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)\n\n(The other four look amazed at the large pot.)\n\nRachel: See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.\n\n(Monica gets up, looks in Rachel's purse.)\n\nMonica: Rachel, there's nothing in it.\n\nRachel: OK, then get me your purse.\n\n(Monica gets Rachel her purse.)\n\nMonica: OK, here you go. Good luck.\n\nRachel: (to Monica): Thank you. (to Ross): I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven.\n\nPhoebe: ...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)\n\n(Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.)\n\nRoss: (to Joey): Joey, I'm a little shy.\n\nJoey: That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?\n\n(Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.)\n\nChandler: (to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?\n\nRoss: Fifteen.\n\nChandler: Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)\n\nJoey: Here, I got five, I got five. (Ross takes the money)\n\nRoss: Thank you.\n\nChandler: Good luck.\n\nRoss: (to Rachel): OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?\n\n(Long pause as they both look at each other.)\n\nRachel: (lays down cards) Full house.\n\n(Ross stares at her. Thinks about it. Puts cards on table, face down.)\n\nRoss: You got me.\n\n(Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.)\n\nJoey: (to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.\n\nChandler: (to Ross): I thought we had them!\n\nRoss: Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. (looks at Rachel) But, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)\n\n(Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.)\n\nClosing Credits\n\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing Pictionary at Monica's apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane.]\n\nChandler: Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!\n\n(Timer goes off.)\n\nRachel: Oh, time's up.\n\nMonica: (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... BIRDIE.\n\nJoey: Oh!\n\nPhoebe: That's a bird?\n\n(Monica glares at Phoebe.)\n\nPhoebe: That's a bird!\n\n(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)\n\nRachel: OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)\n\nChandler: Go.\n\n(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)\n\nRoss: Uh.... bean! Bean!\n\n(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)\n\nJoey: (triumphantly) The Unbearable Likeness of Being!\n\nRachel: Yes!\n\nMonica: That, you get? That, you get?\n\n(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was about to throw it.)\n",
    "This book is a fucking axe to the heart. But because my heart, perhaps yours, too, was broken long ago, no further damage can be done. So perhaps the book's more like a probe, yes, a very discomfiting probe, making a fuller assessment of the wreckage. The book is also a final report of the survey. Finally, one thinks, here\u2019s someone who has not only plumbed the depths of heartbreak, but who\u2019s taken excruciatingly detailed notes along the way revealing every nuance of the required self-abasement. The result is an astonishing catharsis for the reader.\n\nThis is what literature at its best can do. Think Aeschylus\u2019s Oresteia, but with an all-mortal cast and without the choruses. I speak here of the novel\u2019s sheer emotional power.\n\nFor most of the novel the narrative is the first-person thoughts, fantasies, worries, shames and fears of Elio in the summer of his 17th year. The young man is with his parents at their big comfortable summer house on the Italian Riviera. It\u2019s the mid-1980s. The boy\u2019s father is an academic and Oliver, 24, is a young American colleague exchanging some brief work as amanuensis for room and board while finishing his own manuscript. But in the marvelous, big-hearted Italian sense, Oliver, even if for only the six weeks of his stay, is very much a part of the family.\n\nWomen are alluring to Elio but they are not his predominant fascination this particular summer. Description is thin at first, almost transient, and because the reader\u2019s not distracted by descriptive flights he or she never feels far from the anguish of Elio. Life\u2019s first love is the theme, and this iteration is so fresh, so vivid and beautifully layered, that it\u2019s not to be missed. Among the best parts of the novel are those passages in which Elio\u2014before his intimacy with Oliver begins\u2014imagines what he might say to Oliver, the multiple responses he might at any moment utter in Oliver\u2019s presence, or imagined presence. Elio\u2019s mind is racing with alternative scenarios. Is this even what he wants? He\u2019s not sure but he wants to find out. Matters are thought out and after some new bit of action or information, rethought and modified. The technique reminds me of Philip Roth\u2019s American Pastoral, in which circumstances are similarly considered then reconsidered. There is a mastery of tone here that constantly astonishes and bewilders.\n\nLater in the novel, when the description intensifies, it\u2019s as if it has been saved for just these moments of lovemaking, the confidential exchanges between the two in their subsequent walks and swims, their farewell in Rome, the devastating coda. It is the frankness between the two young men that to my mind constitutes the book\u2019s magic. That something as amorphous as desire can be written about with such fluidity and integrity is near miraculous. The wrenching depiction of Elio\u2019s new and utterly discomfiting passion consumes not only him but us as well.\n\nIn closing, let me say that this book is likely to resound more with those with some mileage on them (real or metaphorical). The prerequisite is suffering. One can\u2019t imagine the novel\u2019s insights and wisdom working their wonders on anyone who hasn\u2019t at some time put everything on the line. The end was simply excruciating yet I couldn't stop reading. Extremely powerful. I will reread this one soon. In terms of achievement, I place Call Me By Your Name on the same shelf as Madame Bovary and Lolita and, yes, very near Aeschylus too.",
    "\nChandler: So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?\n\nJoey: Yeah. It's actually our first official date\n\nChandler: Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?\n\nJoey: Naa, no.

I know exactly what I'm gonna do!\n\nChandler: Really? Like you have a routine?\n\nJoey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.\n\nChandler: Really?\n\nJoey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.\n\nChandler: You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)\n\nJoey: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)\n\nChandler: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.

I wonder if I should get one!\n\nChandler: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.\n\nRoss: So, do you get colours or just French tips?\n\nMonica: There. Here's their card.\n\nRoss: Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist.

She called me too! She's the worst!\n\nChandler: Who's Amanda?\n\nMonica: She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) \"Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!\"\n\nChandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?\n\nMonica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!\n\nChandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?\n\nPhoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) \"Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!\" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!\"\n\nMonica: I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.\n\nPhoebe: Oh, I know! \"Oh...I slept with Billy Joel\". All right, who hasn't?\n\nMonica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!\n\nPhoebe: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!\n\nMonica: What?\n\nPhoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!\n\nMonica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?\n\nChandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !\n[Scene: At the tanning salon. Ross and a male assistant are walking through a hall]\n\nAssistant: Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.\nRoss: Well... I like how you look, what are you?\n\nAssistant: Puerto Rican.\n\nRoss: Two, I think a two.\n\nAssistant: You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?\n\nRoss: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.\n\nAssistant: Wow, you catch on quick.\n\nRoss: Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement)\n(Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)\n\nRoss: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)\n\nRoss: You sprayed my front twice!\n\nAssistant: You've never turned?\nRoss: No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.\n\nAssistant: Mississippi? I said count to five'!\n\nRoss: Mississippilesly?

How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!\n\nAssistant: You got two more twos?\n\nRoss: (hysterically) I'm an eight!\n\n[Scene: Joey\u2019s apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room]\n\nRachel: Thanks for dinner.\nJoey: I thought you paid.

Joey does his grazing on Rachel\u2019s thigh and she slaps his hand)\n\nJoey: What\u2019s the matter?\n\nRachel: I am sorry, I don\u2019t know, I am sorry, I don\u2019t know why I did that!\n\nJoey and Rachel: Okay\n\nRachel: Ok, so sorry.\n\n(They start kissing again and, when Joey grazes her thigh, she slaps him on his hand again)\n\nRachel: I am sorry!

I get this uncontrollable need to please people!\n\nPhoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!\n\nMonica: And you would?\n\nPhoebe: I did!\n[scene: Joey\u2019s apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting on the couch]\n\nJoey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this?\nRachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it\u2019s just a little weird, it\u2019s you, and it\u2019s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.\n\nJoey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?\n\nRachel: Ok, let\u2019s work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!\n\nJoey: Ok, yeah, got it.\n\nRachel and Joey: Okay.\n\n(They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely)\n\nJoey: This thing welded shut?!\n\nRachel: Okay.\n\nJoey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.\n\nRachel: Oh!\n\n(Joey starts trying to undo her bra, but it won\u2019t go.The elastic band snaps back, hurting Rachel.)\n\nRachel: Ow!\n\nJoey: Sorry!\n\nRachel: Well this is romantic!\n\nJoey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!\n\nRachel: It\u2019s a standard issue bra clasp!\n\nJoey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!\n\nRachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?\n\nJoey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]\n\n(Chandler is at the table reading; Monica puts some food for him on the table. Ross walks in looking very tanned. Chandler and Monica look up at him smiling.)\n\nChandler: Hold on! There is something different.\n\nRoss: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.\n\nChandler: Was that place... The Sun?\n\nRoss: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)\n\nChandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!\n\nMonica: How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!\n\nRoss: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?\n\nMonica: One Two Three...\n\nRoss: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)\n\nRachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!\n\nRoss: (Still yelling) I Know!\n\nRachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?\n\nChandler: How was your date with Joey?\n\nRachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!\n\nChandler: You didn't like that?\n\nRachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!\n\nMonica: Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.\n\n(Chandler starts looking at her bra)\n\nRachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.\n\nMonica: Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.\n\nRachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!\n\n(Joey walks in)\n\nJoey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).\n\nRachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).\n\n(Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra)\n\nMonica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!\n\nChandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)\n[Scene: Central Perk.]\n\n(Phoebe is sitting on the couch. Monica walks in.)\nMonica: Hey Phoebe!\n\nPhoebe: Hey!\n\nMonica: Is Amanda here yet?\n\nPhoebe: No.\n\nMonica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.\n\nPhoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?\n\nMonica: Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?\n\nPhoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!\n\n(A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda)\n\nPhoebe: Hi!\n\nMonica: Hi!\n\nAmanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)\n\nAmanda: (To Monica) Hello!\n\n(Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.)\n\nAmanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!\n\nMonica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...\n\nAmanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!\n\n(Monica looks shocked)\n\nPhoebe: Musty!\n\nAmanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!\n\nMonica: When were we not friends?\n\nAmanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).\n\nMonica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.\n\nAmanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.\n\nMonica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?\n\nPhoebe: Well...kinda.\n\nMonica: Oh My God!\n\nAmanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!\n\nPhoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an \"ass\".\n\n(Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)\n\nMonica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)\n\nPhoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?\n\nMonica: Nope! (She turns and leaves)\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]\n\n(Joey comes running in.)\nJoey: (To Rachel) Hey!\n\nRachel: Hey! Got champagne?\n\nJoey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!\n\nRachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...\n\nJoey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)\n\nRachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!\n\nJoey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.\n\nRachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?\n\nJoey: Oh! yeah!\n\nRachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)\n\nJoey: uh uh!\n\nRachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!\n\nJoey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!\n\nRachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?\n\nJoey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!\n[Monica and Chandlers apartment.]\n\n(Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.)\nMonica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.\n\nChandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!\n\n(Phoebe and Amanda walk in)\n\nPhoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?\n\nMonica: I have nothing to say to you.\n\nAmanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow, my flat is twice this size!\n\nPhoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?\n\n(They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.)\n\nAmanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.\n\nChandler: Well, aren't you a treat.\n\n[Scene: The hallway]\n\nMonica: I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?\n\nPhoebe: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.\n\nMonica: I'm still all those things!\n\nPhoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!\n\nMonica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.\n\nPhoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.\n\nMonica: It's because I'm scrappy.\n\nPhoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.\n\nMonica: I won't know what I would do without you.\n\n(They hug)\n\nMonica: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.\n\nPhoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.\n\n(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is \"dancing\" for Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)\n\nAmanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.\n\n(Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again)\n[Scene: A different spray-on tan center]\n\n(Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.)\nGlenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...\n\nRoss: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.\n\nGlenda: (quietly) Okay...\n\n(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles at both sides of the wall)\n\nRoss: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?\n\n(He turns around frantically from side to side.)\n\nRoss: Which... which... which... Which one is it?\n\n(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in this face and front again.)\n\nRoss: OH! SON OF A BITCH!\n\n(He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.)\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's]\n\n(Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other)\nRachel: What is the matter with us?\n\nJoey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.\n\nRachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?\n\nJoey: I don't know.\n\n(Chandler enters the apartment)\n\nChandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!\n\nRachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?\n\nChandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...\n\nRachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...\n\nJoey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?\n\nChandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.\n\n(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get to them)\n\nChandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)\n\nRachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.\n\nJoey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.\n\nRachel: Right, totally.\n\nJoey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.\n\nRachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.\n\nJoey: That's a... pla-an.\n\n(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)\n\nJoey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.\n\nRachel: I know.\n\nJoey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.\n\nRachel: Hmmm... Me too...\n\n(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)\n\nRachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?\n\nJoey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.\n\n(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)\n\nRachel: Aah... I bet you're right.\n\n(They look at each other for a while)\n\nJoey: So...\n\nRachel: Yeah.\n\nJoey: I love ya.\n\nRachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.\n\nJoey: Yeah, me too.\n\n(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)\n\nJoey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.\n\n(Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on his sore spot)\nENDING CREDITS\n[Scene: Ross's apartment.]\n\n(Ross is reading a National Geographic on his sofa when Chandler knocks on the door.)\nChandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.\n\n(Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)\n\nRoss: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.\n\nChandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.\n\nRoss: Really? Did you count Mississipily?\n\n(Ross walks to the door and opens it.)\n\nRoss: Dude, you're not tanned.\n\nChandler: No, I just had to get a picture of this.\n\n(Chandler holds up a camera and takes Ross's picture.)\n\nChandler: I see you later!\n\n(Ross closes the door)\n",
    "Woman: My name is Mary Alice young.\n\nWhen you read this morning's paper, you may come across an article about the unusual day I had last week.\n\nNormally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life, but that all changed last Thursday.\n\nOf course, everything seemed quite normal at first.\n\nI made breakfast for my family.\n\nI performed my chores.\n\nI completed my projects.\n\nI ran my errands.\n\nIn truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day...\n\nQuietly polishing the routine of my life until it gleamed with perfection.\n\nThat's why it was so astonishing when I decided to go to my hallway closet and retrieve a revolver that had never been used.\n\nMy body was discovered by my neighbor.\n\nMrs. Martha Huber, who had been startled by a strange popping sound.\n\nHer curiosity aroused, Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason for dropping in on me unannounced.\n\nAfter some initial hesitation, she decided to return the blender she had borrowed from me six months before.\n\nAah!\n\nIt's my neighbor. I think she's been shot.\n\nThere's blood everywhere.\n\nYes.\n\nYou've got to send an ambulance.\n\nYou've got to send one right now.\n\nAnd for a moment, Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen, grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy...\n\nBut only for a moment.\n\nIf there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for, it was her ability to look on the bright side.\n\nI was laid to rest on a Monday.\n\nAfter the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane came to pay their respects.\n\nAnd, as people do in these situations, they brought food.\n\nLynette Scavo brought fried chicken.\n\nLynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.\n\nOf course, she didn't cook much while she was moving up the corporate ladder.\n\nShe didn't have the time.\n\nBut when her doctor announced Lynette was pregnant, her husband Tom had an idea.\n\n\"Why not quit your job?\n\n\"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms.\n\nIt would be so much less stressful.\"\n\nBut this was not the case.\n\nIn fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic, she was now forced to get her fried chicken from a fast-food restaurant.\n\nLynette would have appreciated the irony if she stopped to think about it, but she couldn't. She didn't have the time.\n\nStop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it!\n\nBut, mom!\n\nNo, you are going to behave today.\n\nI am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood.\n\nAnd just so you know how serious I am...\n\nWhat's that?\n\nSanta's cell phone number.\n\nHow'd you get that?\n\nI know someone who knows someone who knows an elf, and if any of you acts up, so help me, I will call Santa, and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.\n\nYou willing to risk that?\n\nMnh-mnh.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet's get this over with.\n\nGabrielle solis, who lives down the block, brought a spicy paella.\n\nSince her modeling days in New York, Gabrielle had developed a taste for rich food...\n\nAnd rich men.\n\nCarlos, who worked in mergers and acquisitions, proposed on their third date.\n\nGabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes, but she soon discovered this happened every time Carlos closed the big deal.\n\nGabrielle liked her paella piping hot.\n\nHowever, her relationship with her husband was considerably cooler.\n\nIf you talk to al Mason at this thing, I want you to casually mention how much I paid for your necklace.\n\nWhy don't I just pin the receipt to my chest?\n\nHe let me know how much he paid for his wife's new convertible.\n\nLook, just work it into the conversation.\n\nThere's no way I can just work that in, Carlos.\n\nWhy not? At the donoghue party, everyone was talking mutual funds, and you found a way to mention you slept with half the yankee outfield.\n\nI'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation.\n\nHey, people are starting to stare.\n\nCan you keep your voice down, please?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWe wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.\n\nBree Van De Kamp, who lives next door, brought baskets of muffins she baked from scratch.\n\nBree was known for her cooking, and for making her own clothes, and for doing her own gardening, and for reupholstering her own furniture.\n\nYes, Bree's many talents were known throughout the neighborhood, and everyone on Wisteria Lane thought of Bree as the perfect wife and mother.\n\nEveryone, that is, except her own family.\n\nPaul.\n\nZachary.\n\nHello, Mrs. Van De Kamp.\n\nBree, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble.\n\nIt was no trouble at all.\n\nNow, the basket with the red ribbon is filled with desserts for your guests, but the one with the blue ribbon is just for you and Zachary.\n\nIt's got rolls, muffins, breakfast-type things.\n\nThank you.\n\nWell, the least I could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning.\n\nI know you're out of your minds with grief.\n\nYes, we are.\n\nOf course, I will need the baskets back once you're done.\n\nOf course.\n\nSusan Mayer, who lives across the street, brought macaroni and cheese.\n\nHer husband Carl always teased her about her macaroni, saying it was the only thing she knew how to cook, and she rarely made it well.\n\nIt was too salty the night she and Carl moved into their house.\n\nIt was too watery the night she found lipstick on Carl's shirt.\n\nShe burned it the night Carl told her he was leaving her for his secretary.\n\nA year had passed since the divorce.\n\nSusan had started to think how nice it would be to have a man in her life, even one who would make fun of her cooking.\n\nMom...\n\nWhy would someone kill themselves?\n\nWell...\n\nSometimes people are so unhappy, they think that's the only way they can solve their problems.\n\nBut Mrs. Young always seemed happy.\n\nYeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside when they're totally different on the inside.\n\nOh, you mean like how dad's girlfriend is always smiling and says nice things, but deep down, you just know she's a bitch?\n\nI don't like that word, Julie.\n\nBut, yeah, that's a great example.\n\nJulie: Hey, what's going on?\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\nHi, Susan.\n\nHey.\n\nSo, what did Carl say when you confronted him?\n\nYou'll love this. He said...\n\n\"It doesn't mean anything. It was just sex.\"\n\nAh, yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook.\n\nYeah, and then he got this zen look on his face, and he said, \"you know, Susan\", most men live lives of quiet desperation.\"\n\nPlease tell me you punched him.\n\nNo, I said, \"really?\"\n\nAnd what do most women lead, lives of noisy fulfillment?\"\n\nHmm. Good for you.\n\nI mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary?\n\nI had that woman over for brunch.\n\nIt's like my grandmother always said...\n\nAn erect penis doesn't have a conscience.\n\nEven the limp ones aren't that ethical.\n\nThis is half the reason I joined the nra.\n\nWell, when Rex started going to those medical conferences, I wanted it in the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home with a loaded Smith & Wesson.\n\nLynnie, Tom's always away on business.\n\nDo you ever worry he might?\n\nOh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years.\n\nI wish he was having sex with someone else.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nSo, Susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI'm sorry, you guys. I just...\n\nI just don't know how I'm going to survive this.\n\nListen to me.\n\nWe all have moments of desperation.\n\nBut if we can face them head-on, that's when we find out just how strong we really are.\n\nSusan.\n\nSusan.\n\nI was just saying Paul wants us to go over on Friday.\n\nHe needs us to go through Mary Alice's closet and help pack up her things.\n\nHe said he can't face doing it by himself.\n\nSure. That's fine.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nYeah.\n\nI'm just so angry.\n\nIf Mary Alice was having problems, she should have come to us.\n\nShe should have let us help her.\n\nWhat kind of problems could she have had?\n\nShe was healthy, had a great home, a nice family.\n\nHer life was...\n\nOur life.\n\nNo, if Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known.\n\nShe lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes.\n\nGabby, the woman killed herself.\n\nSomething must have been going on.\n\nI wouldn't eat that if I were you.\n\nWhy?\n\nI made it. Trust me.\n\nHey, hey, do you... Do you have a death wish?\n\nNo, I just refuse to believe that anybody can screw up macaroni and cheese.\n\nOh, my god.\n\nHow did you...\n\nIt tastes like it's burned andundercooked.\n\nYeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.\n\nHa ha.\n\nUm...\n\nHa ha. Thanks.\n\nI'm Mike Delfino.\n\nI just started renting the Simms house next door.\n\nSusan Mayer. I live across the street.\n\nOh, yeah, Mrs. Huber told me about you.\n\nSaid you illustrate children's books.\n\nYeah, I'm very big with the under-5 set.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nWhat do you do? Plumber.\n\nSo if you ever have a clog...\n\nOr something.\n\nHa ha.\n\nNow that everybody's seen that I brought something, I should probably just throw this out.\n\nHa ha.\n\nOw.\n\nEase up, you little vampire.\n\nLynette, I've been looking all over for you.\n\nAre you aware of what your sons are doing?\n\nBoy: Cannonball!\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nWe are at a wake.\n\nWhen we got here, you said we could go in the pool.\n\nI said you could gobythe pool.\n\nDo you have your swimsuits on?\n\nYeah, we put them under our clothes before we left.\n\nYou three planned this? All right.\n\nThat's it. Get out!\n\nNo! No?\n\nI am your mother.\n\nYou have to do what I say. Come on.\n\nWe want to swim, and you can't stop us!\n\nHere, father.\n\nGet out, or I will get in this pool and just grab you. Get out!\n\nGet over here.\n\nGet... get over here!\n\nAll right, give me your arm. Get back...\n\nYou... ooh!\n\nMove it!\n\nThat's right! Get over here!\n\nGo, go, go, go, go!\n\nMove it!\n\nUgh.\n\nOut! Get out!\n\nPaul, we have to leave now.\n\nOnce again, I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nGo.\n\nMary Alice: Lynette shouldn't have been so concerned about my husband.\n\nHe had other things on his mind...\n\nThings below the surface.\n\nMary Alice: The morning after my funeral, my friends and neighbors quietly went back to their busy, busy lives.\n\nWhile some did their cooking...\n\nAnd some did their cleaning...\n\nAnd some did their yoga...\n\nOthers did their homework.\n\nHi. Shh.\n\nI'm Julie.\n\nI kicked my soccer ball into your backyard.\n\nOh, okay. Well, let's go around and get it.\n\nStay.\n\nHis wife died a year ago. He wanted to stay in L.A., but there were too many memories.\n\nHe's renting for tax purposes, but he hopes to buy a place real soon.\n\nI can't believe you went over there.\n\nHey, I saw you both flirting at the wake.\n\nYou're obviously into each other.\n\nNow that you know he's single, you can ask him out.\n\nJulie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.\n\nI just, uh, I don't even know if I'm ready to start dating yet.\n\nOh, you need to get back out there.\n\nCome on. How long has it been since you've had sex?\n\nAre you mad that I asked you that?\n\nNo, I'm just trying to remember.\n\nI don't want to talk to you about my love life anymore.\n\nIt weirds me out.\n\nI wouldn't have said anything. It's just...\n\nWhat?\n\nI heard dad's girlfriend ask if you'd dated anyone since the divorce, and dad said he doubted it.\n\nAnd then they both laughed.\n\nHey.\n\nSusan. Hi, Mike.\n\nI brought you a little housewarming gift.\n\nI probably should have brought something by earlier, but...\n\nActually, you're the first in the neighborhood to stop by.\n\nReally?\n\nSusan knew she was lucky.\n\nAn eligible bachelor had moved onto Wisteria Lane, and she was the first to find out, but she also knew that good news...\n\nHello there!\n\nTravels quickly.\n\nEdie britt was the most predatory divorc\u00e9e in a 5-block radius.\n\nHer conquests were numerous...\n\nVaried...\n\nAnd legendary.\n\nHi, Susan. I hope I'm not interrupting.\n\nYou must be Mike Delfino.\n\nHi, I'm Edie.\n\nBritt.\n\nI live over there.\n\nWelcome to Wisteria Lane.\n\nSusan had met the enemy, and she was a slut.\n\nThank you. Ha ha. What's this?\n\nSausage putanesca.\n\nIt's just something I threw together.\n\nWell, thanks, Edie. Ha ha.\n\nThat's great.\n\nI'd invite you both in, but I was sort of in the middle of something.\n\nOh, I... no problem.\n\nI'm late for an appointment. I just wanted to say hi.\n\nAnd just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.\n\nFor a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie would remain friendly.\n\nOh, Mike. I heard you're a plumber?\n\nBut she was reminded that when it came to men...\n\nDo you think you could stop by later tonight and take a look at my pipes?\n\nWomen don't fight fair. Sure.\n\nThanks.\n\nBye, Susan.\n\nYou can't order me around like I'm a child.\n\nGabrielle.\n\nNo. No, no, no. I'm not going.\n\nIt's business.\n\nTanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.\n\nEvery time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.\n\nHa ha. I made over $200,000 doing business with him last year.\n\nIf he wants to grab your ass, you let him.\n\nJohn. Ow.\n\nMr. Solis. You scared me.\n\nWhy is that bush still there?\n\nYou were supposed to dig it up last week. I didn't have time last week.\n\nI don't want to hear your excuses.\n\nJust take care of it.\n\nI really hate the way you talk to me.\n\nAnd I really hate that I spend $15,000 on your diamond necklace that you couldn't live without, but I'm learning to deal with it.\n\nSo can I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow night?\n\nJohn.\n\nWe have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.\n\nThanks, Mrs. Solis.\n\nFine. I'll go.\n\nBut I'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.\n\nSee?\n\nNow this is what a marriage is all about...\n\nCompromise.\n\nIs your finger okay?\n\nYeah, yeah, it's just a small cut.\n\nLet me see.\n\nHmm.\n\nYou know, Mrs. Solis, um, I really like it when we hook up, but, um, well, you know, I-I got to get my work done, and I can't afford to lose this job.\n\nThis table is hand-carved.\n\nCarlos had it imported from Italy.\n\nIt cost him $23,000.\n\nYou want to do it on the table this time?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhy can't we ever have normal soup?\n\nDanielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.\n\nJust once, couldn't we have a soup that people have heard of?\n\nLike French onion or Navy bean.\n\nFirst of all, your father can't eat onions.\n\nHe's deathly allergic.\n\nAnd I won't even dignify your Navy bean suggestion.\n\nSo...\n\nHow's the osso buco?\n\nIt's okay.\n\nIt's okay?\n\nAndrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.\n\nHow do you think it makes me feel when you say \"it's okay\" in that sullen tone?\n\nWho asked you to spend three hours on dinner?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nTim Harper's mom gets home from work, pops open a can of pork and beans, and boom, they're eating. Everyone's happy.\n\nYou'd rather I serve pork and beans?\n\nApologize now. I am begging.\n\nI'm saying, do you always have to serve cuisine?\n\nCan't we ever just have food?\n\nAre you doing drugs? What?\n\nChange in behavior is one of the warning signs, and you have been as fresh as paint for the last six months.\n\nThat certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.\n\nTrust me, that is not what he is doing.\n\nShut up.\n\nMom, I'm not the one with the problem here, all right?\n\nYou're the one always acting like she's running for mayor of Stepford.\n\nRex.\n\nSeeing that you're the head of this household, I would really appreciate you saying something.\n\nPass the salt?\n\nMary Alice: Three days after my funeral, Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion...\n\nIndignation.\n\nTom, this is my fifth message, and you still haven't called me back.\n\nWell, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip.\n\nI can only imagine.\n\nWell, guess what...\n\nThe kids and I want to have some fun, too, so unless you call me back by noon, we are getting on a plane and joining you.\n\nMom!\n\nNot now, honey. Mommy's threatening daddy.\n\nMom. No, I...\n\nWhere are your brothers?\n\nNoodles... my favorite.\n\nLynette Scavo?\n\nCrap.\n\nNatalie klein. I don't believe it.\n\nLynette. How long has it been?\n\nYears.\n\nUh, how are you? How's the firm?\n\nGood.\n\nEveryone misses you.\n\nYeah.\n\nWe all say if you hadn't quit, you'd be running the place by now.\n\nYeah, well...\n\nSo...\n\nHow's domestic life?\n\nDon't you just love being a mom?\n\nAnd there it was...\n\nThe question that Lynette always dreaded.\n\nWell, to be honest...\n\nFor those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable, so Lynette responded as she always did.\n\nShe lied.\n\nIt's the best job I've ever had.\n\nBoy: Oh, yeah.\n\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha.\n\nYou know what I don't get?\n\nWhat?\n\nWhy you married Mr. Solis.\n\nWell...\n\nHe promised to give me everything I've ever wanted.\n\nAnd did he?\n\nYes.\n\nThen why aren't you happy?\n\nTurns out I wanted all the wrong things.\n\nSo do you love him?\n\nI do.\n\nWell, then, why are we here?\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nBecause I don't want to wake up one morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.\n\nHey, can I have a drag?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nYou are much too young to smoke.\n\nAh. How would you feel about me using your child-support payments for plastic surgery?\n\nStop being so nervous.\n\nYou're just asking him out to dinner. It's no big deal.\n\nYou're right.\n\nSo is that your project for school?\n\nYou know, when I was in fifth grade, I made the white house out of sugar cubes.\n\nStop stalling and go before Mike figures out he can do better.\n\nTell me again why I fought for custody of you.\n\nYou were using me to hurt dad.\n\nOh, that's right.\n\nOh, god.\n\nHi.\n\nHey, Susan.\n\nAre you busy?\n\nNo, not at all. What's up?\n\nWell, I...\n\nI just, uh, was wondering if, um...\n\nIf there was any chance that you, uh...\n\nI-I just wanted to ask if...\n\nEdie.\n\nHey there, Susan.\n\nWhat are you...\n\nI was making ambrosia, and I made too much, so I thought I'd bring some over to Mike.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nUh, Susan was just going to ask me something.\n\nI have a clog.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nAnd you're a plumber, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nThe clog's in the pipe.\n\nYeah, that's usually where they are.\n\nWell, I've got one.\n\nOh, okay. Well, uh, let me get my tools.\n\nNow? You want to come over now?\n\nYou have company.\n\nI don't mind.\n\nYeah, just give me two minutes.\n\nI'll be right over.\n\nThat's it. Just stuff the hair down there.\n\nI stuffed it. It's not enough to clog it.\n\nHere. Okay, look.\n\nPut in this peanut butter.\n\nAnd this cooking oil.\n\nMom... and these olives.\n\nMom, I'm telling you, it's not working.\n\nOh, god.\n\nThat's him.\n\nHow am I going to stop up the sink?\n\nWell, here's your problem.\n\nLooks like somebody stuffed a bunch of Popsicle sticks down here.\n\nI've told Julie a million times not to play in the kitchen.\n\nKids, you know?\n\nHa ha.\n\nAll right, I'll go put in your orders, and I'll be right back with your drinks and your plates for the salad bar.\n\nThank you.\n\nAndrew, Danielle, napkins?\n\nThey have video games.\n\nCould we go play until our food gets here?\n\nAndrew, this is family time.\n\nI think that we should all... go ahead and play.\n\nI know that you think I'm angry about coming here, but I'm not.\n\nYou and the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun.\n\nI get it.\n\nProbably we'll want something healthier tomorrow night, though.\n\nI'm thinking about chicken saltimbocca.\n\nI want a divorce.\n\nI just can't live in this...\n\nThis detergent commercial anymore.\n\nThe salad bar's right over there.\n\nHelp yourself.\n\nThank you.\n\nUm, I think I'll go get your salad for you.\n\nBree Van De Kamp.\n\nOh.\n\nHello, Mrs. Huber.\n\nWe didn't get a chance to talk at Mary Alice's wake.\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nBree longed to share the truth about her husband's painful betrayal, but sadly for Bree, admitting defeat was not an option.\n\nGreat.\n\nEverything is just great.\n\nOkay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing.\n\nThe ranch looked just a little bit suspect.\n\nAre we going to talk about what I said?\n\nIf you think I'm going to discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled \"chicks\" and \"dudes,\" you're out of your mind.\n\nWhat's in this?\n\nWhat do you mean, what's in this? It's salad.\n\nWith... with onions?\n\nWhat?\n\nYou put onions in my salad.\n\nNo, I didn't.\n\nOh, wait.\n\nThe sound that awakened my son was something he'd heard only once before, many years ago when he was quite young, but he recognized it instantly.\n\nIt was the sound of a family secret.\n\nMary Alice: Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria Lane finally returned to normal, which, for some of my friends...\n\nWas unfortunate.\n\nMommy, mommy!\n\nNow what?\n\nDaddy's home!\n\nHa ha.\n\nHey, is anybody home?\n\nHey!\n\nHey.\n\nI wasn't expecting you for a week.\n\nI have to go back to frisco in the morning, but I got your call. You sounded a little frazzled.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's been a little rough.\n\nHi. Yeah. Mmm, peaches.\n\nDaddy, did you bring us any presents?\n\nOh, god, presents. Wait a minute. Let me see.\n\nOh.\n\nBut I'm not going to give it to you unless you promise me to go outside right now and practice throwing it for 20 minutes, okay?\n\nYou promise?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah! Get out of here. Go.\n\nWho's open? Go out! Deeper! Deeper!\n\nTouchdown!\n\nOh, my god. Oh.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nOh.\n\nOh, you got to be kidding.\n\nI'm exhausted. I look terrible.\n\nI'm covered in peaches.\n\nThat's all right, baby. I got to have you.\n\nWell, is it okay if I just lie here?\n\nAbsolutely. Ha ha.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nI love you.\n\nAnd I love you more.\n\nOh, baby.\n\nOh, wait, I got to tell you, I was having trouble with swelling, so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just going to have to put on a condom.\n\nCondom?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat's the big deal? Let's risk it.\n\nLet's risk it?\n\nYeah.\n\nOh.\n\nI can't believe you tried to kill me.\n\nYes, well, I feel badly about that.\n\nI told you, Mrs. Huber came over, and I got distracted.\n\nIt was a mistake.\n\nSince when do you make mistakes?\n\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\n\nIt means I'm sick of you being so damn perfect all the time.\n\nI-I'm sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn't move.\n\nI'm sick of you making our bed in the morning before I've even used the bathroom.\n\nYou're this plastic suburban housewife with her pearls and her spatula who says things like \"we owe the Hendersons a dinner.\"\n\nWhere's the woman I fell in love with...\n\nWho used to burn the toast and drink milk out of the carton...\n\nAnd laugh?\n\nI need her.\n\nNot this cold, perfect thing you've become.\n\nThese need water.\n\nBree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes, but her husband never knew, because when Bree finally emerged...\n\nShe was perfect.\n\nI found my earrings. We can go now.\n\nWas John here today?\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nThe lawn hasn't been mowed.\n\nI've had it.\n\nWe're getting a real gardener.\n\nWhy? Are you deaf?\n\nI just said he's not doing his job.\n\nIt's dark. You just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.\n\nIt hasn't been. Feel this grass.\n\nI'm not feeling the grass.\n\nLet's just get going. Come on.\n\nWe're late.\n\nTake care of it. Yes, sir.\n\nThere's Tanaka.\n\nTime for me to go into my dance.\n\nGood luck, sweetheart.\n\nOh, excuse me. Ma'am?\n\nYou see that man who just walked away?\n\nCan you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long?\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nOoh!\n\nOoh!\n\nSusan?\n\nSusan.\n\nOh, Mrs. Huber, how you doing?\n\nNot too well, I'm afraid.\n\nI'm trying to find something to soothe my stomach.\n\nOh, it's upset?\n\nYeah.\n\nI had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.\n\nIt's been running through me ever since.\n\nOh.\n\nAnd I need to be at my best.\n\nEdie britt's son is spending the night tonight.\n\nHe's spending the night?\n\nApparently, Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner, and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours, if you know what I mean.\n\nOh, here's some antacid.\n\nHave you ever tried this?\n\nI can't believe it.\n\nThis can't be happening.\n\nMike can't like Edie better than me. He just can't.\n\nYou don't know what's going on.\n\nMaybe they're just having dinner.\n\nYou're right. They're doing it.\n\nEdie?\n\nEdie?\n\nHello?\n\nAnybody home?\n\nI need to borrow sugar.\n\nMarvin gaye: \u266a come on \u266a\n\n\u266a Oh, come on \u266a\n\n\u266a Whoo \u266a\n\n\u266a Let's get it on \u266a\n\n\u266a Ow, baby \u266a\n\n\u266a Let's get it on \u266a\n\n\u266a Let's love, baby \u266a\n\n\u266a Let's get it on \u266a Edie: Oh, my god.\n\nOh, yes.\n\nOh, my god. Give it to me.\n\nMary Alice: And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to, the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.\n\nAnd despite the precariousness of her situation, Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.\n\nOh!\n\nOh, my god.\n\nOh! Oh.\n\nIt didn't take Susan long to realize this was just not her night.\n\nEdie: Is somebody out there?\n\nOh, my god! That's smoke!\n\nWoman on radio: Code 14, call firefighters 130, 92, scout 24, patrolman 42...\n\nCandles unattended in the den.\n\nParamedics said she was lucky. She could have been killed.\n\nOh.\n\nShe ran out with nothing on.\n\nShe was having sex with some guy when the fire started.\n\nWhat happened to him?\n\nHe got smoke inhalation. He's at the hospital.\n\nSusan, are you all right?\n\nYou look awful.\n\nI'm fine. I'm fine.\n\nI-I just, uh...\n\nFeel really bad for Edie.\n\nOh, honey, don't worry about Edie.\n\nShe's a strong lady.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nShe'll get through this.\n\nShe'll find a way to survive.\n\nWe all do.\n\nCome on.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nShe's lucky to be alive.\n\nAll the other houses could have caught on fire.\n\nWow, what happened?\n\nMike.\n\nAnd suddenly, there he was, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes.\n\nI-I thought you were...\n\nUh, where were you?\n\nI just got back from the movies.\n\nEdie had a fire, huh?\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, but she's fine now.\n\nEverything's fine now.\n\nAnd just like that, Susan was happy.\n\nLife was suddenly full of...\n\nPossibilities.\n\nNot to mention a few unexpected surprises.\n\nMan: Hello?\n\nHey, it's me.\n\nDo you have anything yet?\n\nNo. No, nothing yet, but don't worry.\n\nI'm definitely getting closer.\n\nSusan: I brought some champagne.\n\nI thought we should have a toast.\n\nThe next day, my friends came together to pack away my clothes, my personal belongings, and what was left of my life.\n\nAll right, ladies, lift 'em up.\n\nTo Mary Alice...\n\nA good friend and neighbor.\n\nWherever you are, we hope you've found peace.\n\nBree: To Mary Alice.\n\nTo Mary Alice.\n\nLet's get this show on the road.\n\nYou guys check out Mary Alice's clothes?\n\nSize 8? Ha.\n\nShe always told me she was a size 6.\n\nGuess we found the skeleton in her closet.\n\nNot quite, Gabrielle. Not quite.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nIt's a letter addressed to Mary Alice.\n\nHow ironic...\n\nTo have something I tried so desperately to keep secret treated so casually.\n\nWhat are you doing? That's private.\n\nIt's open. What's the big deal?\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nI don't know, but check out the postmark.\n\nOh, my god. She got it the day she died.\n\nDo you think this is why she...\n\nI'm so sorry, girls.\n\nI never wanted you to be burdened with this.\n\nOh, Mary Alice, what did you do?\n",
    "Because Amsterdam is in the Netherlands.\n\nI\u2019m Dutch and proud of it. When I travel abroad I rarely return thinking: \u2018I wish our country had this thing they have there, because it would make our country better\u2019. I genuinely believe I live in one of the best places you could live. We could have adopted the American system of installing traffic lights across the intersections, so you don\u2019t have to hurt your neck looking up at the red light if you\u2019re in the front of the cueue, but that\u2019s about it I think.\n\nExcept for public toilets. We barely have any here, and when we do you have to pay for them.\n\nIt\u2019s the one thing that always struck me when we used to go on holiday by car. You drive a thousand kilometers, cross several countries, make regular stops and everywhere you park your car in any country, there will be restroom facility that is usually clean-ish and free. When you drive back home, having gotten used to this obvious public service it immediately strikes you as soon as you cross the Dutch border: stops don\u2019t even necessarily have toilets. Not all trains have toilets. Shopping malls may not have toilets and the ones that do cost money.\n\nIt\u2019s getting better, but we still put new trains into service that don\u2019t have toilets, we still build train and subway stations, or shopping malls without toilets. It\u2019s a weird blind spot of the Dutch and the difference is striking; all surrounding countries; England, Germany, Belgium - they all have public toilet facilities wherever you\u2019d expect them, but we don\u2019t; at least not necessarily.\n\nWe\u2019re bad at public toilets. I have no explanation for it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlthough I still stand by my answer in the sense that I think that I genuinely believe that the Netherlands isn\u2019t as generous with public toilets as several other countries are in my personal experience, it is now clear from the comments that it led some people to assume that The Netherlands is a country that you should avoid if you have some kind of medical problem that requires you to have good access to public facilities.\n\nAlthough we can surely stand to lose some tourists in Amsterdam so in a way this outcome would be a win, I think we need some perspective here. What I\u2019m talking about is that the situation here could easily be a lot better and there are in fact places that have the toilet situation better organised than we do. But if you scan the comments you can find plenty of responses from Germans and Italians that claim that it\u2019s just the same where they live. There is a certain \u2018in the eye of the beholder\u2019 thing at play here as well.\n\nOf course you would be able to go to the toilet here. My point was really that considering how well our country is organised on average, it\u2019s strange that the restroom situation isn\u2019t also \u2018among the best in the world\u2019. That was my real point. I wasn\u2019t going to mention it, but the recent comments seem to all be from elderly people changing travel plans to avoid Amsterdam in order to not get in trouble due to their tricky bladder. By all means, give Amsterdam a miss; we\u2019re looking for ways to reduce overtourism here, but we were thinking more about the no-money backpackers and weekend drinkers, and not the more affluent ones with bladder issues.\n\nWe do have public toilets. You can, usually, use toilets in bars and restaurants. We\u2019re not some weird \u2018anti-toilet\u2019 country. We\u2019re merely \u2018not quite as good\u2019 as I think we should be.",
    "Sure, I was looking forward to getting to watch director Denis Villeneuve's take on Frank Herbert's iconic story \"Dune\". And yeah, I did also enjoy the 1984 version of the tale, so of course this 2021 version was something that had to be watched.\n\nAnd yes, I did enjoy the 2021 rendering of \"Dune\", of course I did. I mean, how could I not? Despite of running for a bit more than two and a half hours, the movie was entertaining and enjoyable. And this was just the first part of the story, so we are in for more.\n\nVisually then \"Dune\" was just spectacular, having pretty amazing special effects that brought the world of Arrakis to life on the screen. And if you enjoy CGI effects and great special effects, then \"Dune\" doesn't disappoint.\n\nIn terms of casted performers, then the majority of the cast were actually nicely cast for the various roles and characters. Now, I am not familiar with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (playing Paul Atreides), but he was no Kyle MacLachlan (playing the same character in the 1984 movie). This 2021 version of \"Dune\" also have the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd on the cast list. I was really impressed with Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in the movie.\n\nAnd while \"Dune\" is watchable and entertaining, I must admit that I was left with a sense of 'was this really a necessary remake?' once the movie ended. And then my thoughts went on to \"will it be remade again in 40 years, with whatever technology is available then?'. So there was that whole whether this remake was a necessary thing or not looming over it.\n\nAnd I also feel that the character gallery was a bit underdeveloped, as I felt most of the characters were only given superficial characteristics and personalities, never letting the audience really get to know the characters backgrounds, motivations and such. It just felt a bit too shallow in terms of character development and growth.\n\nIf you have the chance to watch \"Dune\", then do so. By all means do so, because it is an entertaining movie.\n\nMy rating of \"Dune\" lands on a six out of ten stars, like the 1984 movie. Sure, this 2021 movie was more pleasing to look at, but of course almost 40 years have done lots to the development of CGI in the movie business. But the 2021 version is held back by an inferior character gallery and that overwhelming sense of this being essentially just a massive waste of money and effort in terms of remaking something that didn't really need to be remade.",
    "At the very end of \"Dune,\" Denis Villeneuve's attempt to make a screen version of the novel that isn't a disaster, a character says, \"This is only the beginning.\" The line is meant to be an enticing promise of what's yet to come. To me it sounded like a threat. I knew this was only the first of a two-part movie, and yet this bit of news still managed to be one of the most demoralizing things I've heard in a long time.\n\nThe creators of \"Dune\" clearly love the source material and have attempted to make something true to it with much care and love. But they've somehow still managed to make a lifeless, dramatically inert bungle of it. I didn't feel a single thing during this nearly three-hour movie, except the urge to pee, which I knew would happen given the size of the Modelo I bought at the concession. Seriously, you should have seen this Modelo. I paid $13 dollars for it, which was almost as much as the amount I paid for the movie ticket and parking combined. At first I was astounded, but then I saw the can they were handing to me. It was like I got my own personal keg of beer. This is the first time I've ever had a movie end and realize that I still had beer to drink, which I chugged during the closing credits.\n\nWait...did I wander away from the subject of \"Dune?\" That's because the story of my beer is more interesting than this movie. Have you ever seen the musical \"Urinetown?\" If you have, you know that there's a song at the beginning about how the characters don't want to overload the audience with too much exposition right off the bat. The creators of \"Dune\" should have watched \"Urinetown.\" This movie is nothing but exposition. We have to have someone explaining something to us in every scene. At one point, there's even a five minute scene where one character literally tells the other characters how their suits work. It's like a mechanic explaining to you how a car engine works when you're not that into cars. There's an audience for it, but I'm not it.\n\nOne brown, ponderous scene follows another, while Hans Zimmer's screeching score drones on and on. At first it was just there, but by the end of the movie the music had me wanting to climb the walls. It becomes a parody of itself. By the time a bunch of female vocalists came on the soundtrack wailing in something resembling a Middle Eastern way, I had decided that this might be one of the worst scores Zimmer has ever composed.\n\nThe movie never changes tone. I mean never. It never changes pace. I mean never. I suppose during some action scenes the editing literally gets faster, but the scenes still somehow manage to remain lifeless and unexciting. I never felt a sense of adventure, which is odd for a movie about a young man who gets the opportunity to leave his home planet and experience something new. I never cared about anything. None of the actors seem to be having any fun being in this movie. Timothee Chalamet is pretty as a postcard, but he has exactly one facial expression. Oscar Isaac is in this. So is Jason Mamoa. So is Josh Brolin. So is Javier Bardem. Lots of good talent. All of it swamped by colorless production design.\n\nThis is the kind of movie with rabid fans who will tell you that there's something wrong with you for not liking it. I can just hear them saying things like \"Stick to 'The Fast and the Furious' you nincompoops who are too stupid to understand such profound things as 'Dune',\" as if they have any idea who I am or what my movie tastes are. Let those people get their knickers in a twist, and let those who also thought this movie was a boring slog join me for a keg-sized Modelo. Cheers!",
    "I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)\n\ni mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movie\n\noverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.\n\nThings that bothered me (without spoilers)\n\n-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything\n\n-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene\n\n-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me\n\n-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged about\n\nthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck\n\n\n-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?\n\n-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.\n\n-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next.",
    "I'm a student renting a room in the Netheralands. For the last two days, starting at 9am, there has been some sort of construction happening right next to my room on the other side of the wall.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that I really don't mind some noise, I've lived with lots of partying, rowdy students and I've never even thought to complain once. I can tolerate a lot when it comes to a noisy situation, so I never thought I would be in this position.\n\nBut the noise this machine is making is close to earth-shattering. I don't know what they're doing there, but it sounds like they're drilling giant holes into the wall, except it starts at 9am and goes on non-stop for several hours. Yesterday they stopped around 2-3pm.\n\nIt's so bad that I'm wearing noise-cancelling earphones and I can still barely hear myself think. And because of covid there's nowhere else I can go except my room.\n\nDo I have any rights here? Surely there is a legal limit to how much noise you can make in a residential area (even when it's for doing construction)?\n\nThanks, in advance, for any information and help!",
    "I was a diehard solo hiker B.K. (before kids). Then one bouncy baby arrived, then another, then another\u2014and they bounced me out of my solo travel world. My alone time might have been long gone, but being a mom wasn't going to stop me from exploring America on foot. I swapped out the fanny pack and two-seater for a stocked SUV and jumbo backpack, and hit the trails with my new brood.\n\nWith lots of little legs to contend with, our first walks were short (and often migraine-inducing!), but I learned important life lessons. My kids didn't care how far we went\u2013what they loved was the sense of discovery. We checked out the wildflowers and studied animal tracks. We floated leaves and twigs down streams and skipped rocks across ponds. I would've missed all these things during my pre-fam hiking days\u2013back then, I was all about mileage and getting to the end-of-the-trail sign. \n\nAs my kids, and their stamina, grew, we dove into more challenging trails: surveying trail maps, developing climbing routes, and packing plenty of snacks for the journey. My boys always wanted to see wildlife, while my daughter would risk a slip on a muddy trail for a view of a waterfall, just like her mom. We found a way to meet everyone's needs\u2014and we've done that for years, one step at a time, from Maine to Hawaii.\n\nSo whether you're looking to up your hiking game or just getting started, there's a trek out there for you and your fam. These 12 stand out for their eye-popping natural beauty, relative ease, and zero WiFi. Because really, who couldn't use some old-school QT with their crew? \n\nGreat Head Trail in Maine\u2019s Acadia National Park\nIn the East Coast, Maine\u2019s Acadia Park has been my family's go-to hiking destination for years. With waves crashing against a rocky shore and towering  mountain peaks, the area's natural beauty is mind-blowing. The park has just over 130 trails to tackle, but the 1.8-mile Great Head Trail Loop is tops. Along with expansive Atlantic Ocean views, the trek leads you through shaded forest and past the ruins of an early-1900s tea house. If the rocky outcroppings are too intense for the little ones in your group, take the gentle incline through the trees.  When you can barely feel your legs anymore, nearby Sand Beach is the place to kick back for a picnic. \n\nSleeping Beauty Mountain Trail in New York\u2019s Adirondack Mountains\nIn my family, a name can be enough to pique our interest. That was the case with Sleeping Beauty trail in the Adirondacks. If your clan is ready to summit a mountain, this is the spot to do it.  The peaks here are lower than in other places in the East Coast and out West, where they can reach up to 14,000 feet (too high for my three). Located minutes from the resort town of Lake George, Sleeping Beauty tops out at 4,907 feet. From the parking area, it\u2019s a 1.8-mile, one-way hike to the summit that ascends just over 1,000 feet, which is doable with school-aged kids. Go in October or November, when the maples, aspens, birch, and ash trees come alive with fall colors.  \n\nQueens Garden and Navajo Loop in Bryce Canyon, Utah\nIt's no secret: Utah's Mighty 5 are a must for the hiking obsessed. Zion and Arches get most of the glory, but the number of visitors often outshine the wildlife. So we drove up the road to Bryce for another majestic landscape with fewer crowds and cooler temps.  The various trailheads at Bryce turn off the main Rim Trail, so families can pick and choose their hiking adventure. \n\nFor those with young ones, the Sunset Point to Sunrise Point trail is the way to go: It's a one-mile paved trek that passes tall, red-rock limestone walls and overlooks the Bryce Canyon Amphitheater. If you want to take your adventure up a notch, you can't go wrong with these two trails: the nearly two-mile Queen\u2019s Garden, which descends into the canyon; and the three-mile Navajo Loop, which passes Thor\u2019s Hammer and Two Bridges. \n\nKelly Park Rock Springs Trail in Central Florida\nWhen you're in the sweltering Sunshine State, it's hard not to follow a hike with a refreshing swim (at least that's how we feel). A 30-mile drive north from Orlando takes you to Rock Spring, a natural watering hole bordered by palm trees and ferns. You'll be transported to what feels more like a tropical oasis than a Florida park. \n\nThe low-key, 0.9-mile trail circles the swimming area and there's a suspension bridge that the little ones will love. Bring your swimsuits\u2014the water at Rocks Springs is crystal clear and is edged by large rocks that are perfect for sun lounging. \n\nLaurel Falls Trail in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee\nHere\u2019s a universal truth: Everyone loves a waterfall. So trekking with the fam through the Great Smoky Mountains to a gorgeous rush of water is a no-brainer. The Laurel Falls Trail is a 2.6-mile paved, round-trip hike on the Tennessee side of the park, not far from Gatlinburg. During the trek, you'll see the namesake evergreen shrub, the laurel, and pass by yellow birch, maple, scarlet oak, and pine trees until you reach Laurel Falls. The falls are spectacular and cascade down 80 feet over several rock ledges. Heads-up: The hike is gentle enough to push a jogging stroller but you'll want to set out early. The area gets packed. \n\nSummit Trail at Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, Texas\nThe views at the top of Summit Trail are well worth the 1.3-mile climb up the pink granite mountain. At the end, you'll be rewarded with 360-degree views of Texas Hill Country and rainwater pools teeming with fairy shrimp. My school-aged kids tackled the moderate incline without stopping (I can\u2019t say the same) even though the route has no defined switchbacks. The area has restrooms and a place to picnic but no concession stand, so make sure to bring snacks and water.  Timed entry reservations are required. \n\n\nLily Lake Loop in Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountain National Park\nThere's always a breeze at Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park, even in the height of summer (which is highly appreciated by my clan). We always do Lily Lake Loop, a relatively level 0.8-mile trail that's doable with a jogging stroller. The older kids can skip rocks while walking along the various boardwalks and paved gravel that border the lake. There's great fishing here, too, so bring your poles to scout for the popular greenback cutthroat trout. For me, the Rocky Mountain scenery steals the show with its fir tree covered slopes and granite peaks dotted with wildflowers. \n\nWest Beach\u2019s Dune Succession Trail in Indiana Dunes National Park, Indiana\nLess than 50 miles south from Chicago\u2019s Magnificent Mile is one of the newest U.S. national parks, Indiana Dunes. With hiking, biking and beach-going available, the park offers the best of both worlds: heart-pumping activity and some R&R. \n\nThe dune succession trail is a 0.9-mile hike with 270 stairs\u2013yes, it sounds daunting but the stairs are wide and kid-friendly and there\u2019s a beach on the other side to motivate the team. Along the trail, signage teaches you all about \"Diana of the Dunes,\" an early conservationist from the area. Make sure to carry backpack beach chairs and plenty of sunscreen\u2014the waters of Lake Michigan are so clear and blue, your kids may beg to stay for hours (mine did). \n\nCathedral Spires Trail in Custer State Park, South Dakota\nEqual parts wildlife destination and rock climber\u2019s dream, Custer State Park is in the famed Black Hills of South Dakota. It's an under-the-radar family getaway that also happens to be former president Calvin Coolidge\u2019s summer escape. We were blown away the first time we visited, and we've been back many times since.\n\nAt the northwest section of the park, there's a great 1.6-mile in-and-out trail with some bouldering that the kids can get into. We walked past ponderosa pine, spruce, and quaking aspen while marveling at the sky-high granite formations, which inspired the sculptor Gutzon Borglum to create Mount Rushmore. Keep an eye out for the cute mountain goats who frequently stand on the ledges. Warning: There are no restrooms in the area so stop for a bathroom break at Sylvan Lake, a couple of miles away by car. \n\nTahoe Meadows Loop in Lake Tahoe, Nevada\nWith wildflower beds, a babbling brook, and tons of boardwalks to cross, the 1.3-mile Tahoe Meadows Loop is my family\u2019s favorite in the region. It\u2019s set in a valley between peaks, so the hike is relatively flat and leashed dogs are even welcome. If you're looking for something more challenging, the loop connects with the Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT), a 170-mile trek that rings the lake. The area's best-selling asset: You can go there during summer, fall, and winter (and the restrooms are open year-round, which is not always guaranteed!). During the snowy months, bring your own gear for snow-shoeing and sledding. \n\nHall of Mosses at Hoh Rainforest in Washington\u2019s Olympic National Park\nEverything is lush and green at Hoh Rainforest\u2014what else would you expect in a land with 12 feet of annual rain? \n\nStart your hiking adventure at the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center to learn about the North American temperate rain forest that runs from California to Alaska.  After taking in the giant spruce trees dripping in moss\u2014we felt like hobbits in proportion\u2014make your way along the 0.8-mile Hall of Mosses Trail to spot nurse logs (downed trees that foster new growth). If the hike is too laid back for your group, there are two others worth checking out: the two-mile Spruce Nature Trail and the 35-mile Hoh River Trail that runs all the way to Blue Glacier. Keep your eyes peeled for animals like Roosevelt Elk and banana slugs. \n\nManoa Falls Trail on Oahu, Hawaii\nThe trail to Manoa Falls is like walking through a movie set of the great outdoors\u2014it\u2019s a 1.6-mile in-and-out hike through a shady, mossy, drippy rainforest with towering versions of your barely-alive houseplants. It's no wonder Jurassic Park, Lost, and throwback fave Hawaii Five-O were filmed in the area. The trail opens up to a jaw-dropping 150-foot waterfall that sweeps down a black lava rock face, which is easily accessible for young kids and teens. Tip: Manoa Falls is muddy and slick so it\u2019s a no-go for strollers. My kids trekked in swimsuits and hiking sandals and then found a hose in the parking lot to wash off the mud.",

He deserves to have all the facts.\n\nShe abandoned her husband and her son, and I'll never forgive her.\n\nIt's the age-old question, isn't it?\n\nHow much do we really want to know about our neighbors?\n\nYou're going to cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer, and we're going to find ourselves a marriage counselor.\n\nI'm Mike Delfino. Susan Mayer. I live across the street.\n\nIf you want to date him, you're going to have to ask him out.\n\nI keep hoping he'll ask me out.\n\nI really hate the way you talk to me.\n\nAnd I really hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace, but I'm learning to deal with it.\n\nDo you love him? I do.\n\nWell, then, why are we here?\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nBecause I don't want to wake up one morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.\n\nMary Alice: After I died, I began to surrender the parts of myself that were no longer necessary.\n\nMy desires, beliefs, ambitions, doubts...\n\nEvery trace of my humanity was discarded.\n\nYou see, I feel, when moving through eternity, it helps to travel lightly.\n\nIn fact, I held on to only one thing...\n\nMy memory.\n\nIt's astonishing to look back on the world I left behind.\n\nI remember it all... Every single detail.\n\nLike my friend Bree.\n\nI remember the easy confidence of her smile, the gentle elegance of her hands, the refined warmth of her voice.\n\nBye.\n\nBut what I remember most about Bree was the look of fear in her eyes.\n\nAnd for a woman who despised loose ends, that was unacceptable.\n\nRex.\n\nRex. You need to get up.\n\nIt's not even light out.\n\nPlease hurry. If the kids see you sleeping down here, they're going to start asking questions.\n\nLet 'em ask. I don't care anymore.\n\nWell, I care.\n\nThey don't need to be burdened with our marital problems, and while we're working things out, the least we can do is try to keep up appearances.\n\nOh, yeah. Appearances.\n\nI keep forgetting about appearances.\n\nOh, Rex, you look so tired.\n\nI didn't sleep.\n\nThis damn thing is so uncomfortable.\n\nWell, why don't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?\n\nWe're in marriage counseling, Bree.\n\nI think that would confuse things.\n\nIt's just... I miss you.\n\nI know you do.\n\nOf course, if I don't start getting some sleep pretty soon, I'll be forced to move back upstairs out of sheer exhaustion.\n\nYes, Bree was afraid of many things, but if there was one thing she wasn't afraid of...\n\nIt was a challenge.\n\nMary Alice: The day on Wisteria Lane began like any other day...\n\nWith a cup of coffee and the morning paper.\n\nWhile Lynette read about a hostile takeover in the business section and Gabrielle studied the fall collection and Bree searched for decorating ideas, Susan scanned the front page and saw something that caught her eye.\n\nWell, it's about time.\n\nBe nice. I come bearing snacks.\n\nBree: Lynette, these cards are sticky.\n\nI know. Preston used the 3 of diamonds to scoop jam out of a jar.\n\nWell, we're just thankful we have 49 cards to play with.\n\nSusan: Hello. Sorry I'm late.\n\nHey.\n\nSo, Susan, I was just telling the girls I want to throw a dinner party.\n\nReally? Yes.\n\nHow long have we all lived on this street?\n\nWe've never done a big group thing.\n\nI think it's a great idea.\n\nPaul never likes to have people over, but to heck with him. I'm doing it.\n\nSo when is this shindig?\n\nHow about a month from tonight?\n\nThat would be the 9th. Good for everyone?\n\nSure. Works for me.\n\nShall we all make something?\n\nOh, no, no. This is my party.\n\nI've been wanting to have everyone over for years.\n\nOh, I'm so happy we're finally doing this.\n\nIt's going to be so much fun.\n\nHey.\n\nI know. Her dinner.\n\nHow could we have all forgotten about this?\n\nWe didn't exactly forget. It's just usually, when the hostess dies, the party's off.\n\nLynette.\n\nI'm not being flip. I'm just pointing out a reality.\n\nMary Alice was so excited about it. It's so sad.\n\nI think we should go through with it.\n\nReally? Wouldn't that be in poor taste?\n\nNo. It's sort of a way to honor Mary Alice.\n\nIt was so important to her.\n\nWe could all use a fun night.\n\nWell, good, because I have some new flatware that I've just been dying to show off.\n\nLynette? I'm in.\n\nI'll make braised lamb shanks. I'm still in.\n\nSo how many will I be cooking for?\n\nSeven... three couples and Susan.\n\nDoes that sound right?\n\nNo, it sounds very, very wrong.\n\nOh, is there somebody you'd like to invite?\n\nI have an idea.\n\nA dinner party. Honey, I may be working late.\n\nThe dillman proposal's a complete mess.\n\nNo, no, you promised to be home every night this week.\n\nI'll try, but I can't guarantee anything.\n\nThis is business.\n\nSays the prince as he rides off into the sunset.\n\nBoy, did the movies ever get that wrong.\n\nYou know what your problem is? You're very tense.\n\nYou should go to a spa or go shopping.\n\nFind a way to relax.\n\nHello?\n\nWhere are you?\n\nAlgebra.\n\nYou free at 4:00?\n\nI'm not sure. I got track after school.\n\nWell, get here as fast as you can.\n\nMy husband says I need to relax.\n\nYou, uh, want me to keep my gym clothes on like last time?\n\nIf you would, please.\n\nA dinner party? Yeah, it'll be fun.\n\nBree's cooking, everyone's coming.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI haven't even had a chance to unpack yet, honey.\n\nI just, uh, I just need to chill out for the next few days.\n\nOh, Tom.\n\nThere'll be liquor and hors d'oeuvres and grownups without children and...\n\nAnd silverware. Remember silverware?\n\nHoney, can you take this in for me?\n\nHave you heard anything I just said?\n\nYeah, I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm wiped out.\n\nThree cities in six days... My head is just pounding.\n\nI'm not ready for a dinner party.\n\nI already got a sitter.\n\nCan you cancel her? Please?\n\nLook, let's just stay in tomorrow night.\n\nWe can get a bottle of wine and rent a video, and I-I just want to hang out with my best gal.\n\nThat's all.\n\nI was looking so forward to a night out.\n\nI know, sweetie, I'm sorry, but...\n\nI'm beat.\n\nI mean, do you remember what it was like to work a 60-hour week?\n\nA dinner party?\n\nDo I have to go?\n\nWell, given that we're hosting it, I'd say so.\n\nBy the way, you won't be drinking at this party.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nBecause when you drink, you get chatty.\n\nNo one needs to know that we're seeing Dr. Goldfine.\n\nYou know, if you spent half as much time working on our problems as you do covering them...\n\nNot a drop.\n\nYou know, this... This is ridiculous.\n\nAnd this whole thing about us taking tennis lessons?\n\nWell, the nurses at your office may start wondering why you're disappearing three times a week.\n\nTennis lessons are a plausible alibi.\n\nAll right, so, these tennis lessons we're taking... How are we doing?\n\nMy backhand's improving immensely, but you're still having problems with your serve.\n\nOf course.\n\nA dinner party?\n\nIt's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep Julie an extra day.\n\nFine, but that's all. Brandy and I leave sunday for a week up at the cabin.\n\nWhat cabin?\n\nBrandy wanted some place where we could get away.\n\nEscrow just closed yesterday.\n\nYou can afford a cabin, but you can't scrape up child support?\n\nThe check is in the mail.\n\nOh.\n\nNo, it's not.\n\nI found my dental guard. I'm ready.\n\nStop fighting.\n\nWe are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.\n\nLike I said, stop fighting.\n\nHa ha.\n\nExcuse me, Brandy.\n\nDo you mind?\n\nOh, okay.\n\nWait. Susan, you're right there.\n\nYou can pick it up.\n\nI could, but she's the one who threw it.\n\nCome on. Don't be petulant.\n\nJust pick up the stupid can.\n\nNo.\n\nI can pick it up.\n\nHoney, stay out of this.\n\nFine.\n\nThis is so typical.\n\nOh, I'm sorry. Was that petulant, too?\n\nYou know what?\n\nYou can pick up the damn can yourself.\n\nYeah, well, you just go to hell.\n\nYou want me to pick it up?\n\nUh...\n\nMrs. Warmington said she looked for mom's obituary and couldn't find it.\n\nDid you put one in?\n\nI've had other things on my mind, Zach.\n\nBut how could you not do that?\n\nPeople are going to think we didn't care about her.\n\nI doubt people will give it much thought.\n\nDon't worry about it.\n\nYou never talk about her.\n\nShe hasn't even been dead a month, and it's like you've totally forgotten she ever existed.\n\nIt's a little early for this kind of talk.\n\nMaybe when you die, I won't put in an obituary.\n\nThat will be your choice to make.\n\nAssuming you outlive me.\n\nMom, it's no big deal.\n\nCarlos and I are driving in for the baptism.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nYou go with aunt Maria, and I will take Nana to church.\n\nTake your clothes off.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nOkay. I got to go, mom.\n\nYes, right now.\n\nOkay, uh, you can give me directions later. Bye.\n\nHi. How was school?\n\nGot an a-minus on my biology exam.\n\nYou did? Mm.\n\nWell, let's see what you've learned.\n\nWho's that?\n\nI don't know.\n\nHey, you!\n\nOh.\n\nSo did Mike say anything?\n\nNo, but, god, you should have seen the look on his face.\n\nI'm sure it's not that bad.\n\nI mean, he's coming to the party, right?\n\nI left three messages.\n\nOh, he's not going to come. Big surprise.\n\nI did everything but foam at the mouth.\n\nGod, I hate when I get that way.\n\nIt's like every time I get within 10 feet of Carl, I just become this monster.\n\nYou know what? It's not going to change until you resolve your issues with that man.\n\nWhat, you mean forgive him?\n\nYou know, I've lived with this bitterness so long, I think I'd be lonely without it.\n\nHoney, get a pet.\n\nHa ha.\n\nSee ya.\n\nSon of a...\n\nIt's a business meeting.\n\nIt's a frat party.\n\nRegional manager, corporate manager, head of sales.\n\nMargarita, cigar, sombrero.\n\nOkay.\n\nHoney, what do you want me to do, sit around the hotel the whole time watching cable?\n\nNo. But when I say, \"we've been invited to a party,\" don't whine about your exhausting 60-hour week.\n\nPut on your dancin' shoes and take the mother of your children out for a good time.\n\nFine. You know what? You're right.\n\nLet's go to that party.\n\nI can't. I already canceled the sitter.\n\nOkay, well, we'll throw the next one.\n\nThrow a dinner party?\n\nI don't even have time to wash my face.\n\nNo, you know what?\n\nI'm going to go to this one.\n\nYou can stay home and babysit the kids.\n\nFine.\n\nI can handle that.\n\nThank you.\n\nMary Alice: Gabrielle spent her morning searching for the mysterious little girl.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the mystery was solved a bit too quickly.\n\nHey.\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nHave you met Ashley?\n\nWoman: Found it!\n\nBabe, this is Sheila bukowski, our new neighbor.\n\nThey just moved into the Millers' old house.\n\nMy daughter left her ball in your yard.\n\nI'm so sorry.\n\nOh, oh, no... no problem.\n\nNice to meet you, Ashley.\n\nShe's shy. She doesn't say much.\n\nYeah, but I can see her little mind working away.\n\nHa ha ha ha.\n\nNice meeting you. Mm-hmm.\n\nCome on, Ashley.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nPrivate sessions?\n\nI don't understand. Why do we need private sessions?\n\nPrivate sessions allow us to work on the personal issues of both partners.\n\nOh, well, I don't have any personal issues.\n\nMy only issue is that my husband wants to leave me, and how can I work on that if he's not in the room?\n\nThere are things I need to discuss with Dr. Goldfine, and I can't have you there.\n\nWhy?\n\nI'm your wife. You can say anything in front of me.\n\nAll we need is a few more sessions, and I'm sure we can...\n\nDamn it, Bree, a few more sessions isn't going to fix us.\n\nThis is bigger than that.\n\nWhy don't we do it this way?\n\nRex, you can take the first half-hour.\n\nBree, you can take the second.\n\nFine.\n\nOh, and, doctor, if what he's about to discuss has anything to do with adultery, prostitution, or Internet pornography, I would really appreciate you taking a moral hard line.\n\nHi, Ashley.\n\nRemember me?\n\nWe... we met earlier.\n\nWow.\n\nAren't you the little artist? Ha ha.\n\nWhat are those... flamingos?\n\nNo.\n\nWell, they're very pretty.\n\nIt almost looks like they're kissing.\n\nFunny thing about kissing...\n\nIt's not just for husbands and wives.\n\nSometimes we kiss our mom or our grandpa.\n\nSometimes we even kiss our dog. Ha ha.\n\nSometimes we even kiss people who are just our friends, kind of like a high-five on the lips.\n\nRight? Ha ha.\n\nUh...\n\nHey, ash, I was at the mall, and I saw this.\n\nI thought you might like it.\n\nShe's Hawaiian.\n\nHer name is Princess kahalua, and I think it means \"little waterfall,\" or \"big pond\" or something.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo we're good, right?\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, you enjoy your new little friend, and if there's anything else you need, you just let me know. Ha ha.\n\nWhat I'd really like is a bike.\n\nWhere did you find that?\n\nShe used this to kill herself.\n\nWhy would you keep it?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I thought we might need it someday.\n\nFor what?\n\nProtection.\n\nI want to talk about mom.\n\nYou need to take your medication.\n\nWe are going to talk about mom.\n\nHello, Zach.\n\nI hope this isn't a bad time.\n\nWhat can I do for you, Mrs. Van De Kamp?\n\nWell, I wanted to invite you and your father to a dinner party tomorrow night.\n\nI'm not sure where he is right now.\n\nOh.\n\nWell, I'm sorry it's such late notice, but, well, we weren't sure that you and your father were ready for any kind of social engagement yet, but, well, we're...\n\nWe're sort of throwing it in your mother's honor.\n\nReally?\n\nYes, it's just going to be a casual night with the gang.\n\nWe're going to eat and tell fun stories about your mom.\n\nZach...\n\nAre you okay?\n\nHello, Bree.\n\nOh, hi, Paul. I was just...\n\nI heard.\n\nThank you, but we already have plans for tomorrow.\n\nOh. That's too bad.\n\nWell, I should go.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Van De Kamp.\n\nFor what, Zach?\n\nFor remembering my mom.\n\nMm.\n\nMary Alice: That night, Paul gave his son something to calm his nerves, and the next day, Gabrielle calmed her own nerves by giving something to her new best friend.\n\nHere you go.\n\nTop of the line, 3-speed, aluminum frame, handlebar ribbons, and a bell, and you'll notice it's royal blue to match your pretty little eyes.\n\nMy eyes are green.\n\nYeah, well, you'll be cruising so fast on this, no one will even notice. It's all yours, hon.\n\nHave fun.\n\nWhat? What's wrong?\n\nI don't know how to ride a bike.\n\nWhat?\n\nWell, then, why did you ask for one?\n\nWhy can't you show me?\n\nHa ha.\n\nSure, one of these days.\n\nWhat's wrong with now?\n\nAfter her talk with Lynette, Susan had decided to take a look at her old photo album.\n\nSusan began to see herself in a whole new light, and the picture wasn't at all flattering.\n\nCarl: Yep, you got Carl. Leave a message.\n\nHey, Carl, it's me.\n\nI was hoping you'd be there.\n\nUm, listen, we need to talk, so maybe when you drop Julie off tomorrow, we could have a moment. It's important.\n\nGive my best to...\n\nBrandy.\n\nCall me.\n\nSusan was proud of herself.\n\nShe was finally ready to let go of her anger.\n\nWell, almost.\n\nThe boys will be hungry at 5:30, so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5:00.\n\nFor half an hour. Honey, I know.\n\nThis is the third time you've told me.\n\nWell, if the food's late, god help you.\n\nBeautiful, I don't need a pamphlet.\n\nIt's not brain surgery.\n\nThey're just kids, for god's sake.\n\nPreston, would you come here?\n\nYes?\n\nSweetie, you know our rule about eating cookies, right?\n\nYeah, we can't have them after 5:00\n\n'cause sugar makes us hyper.\n\nYeah, but tonight, anything goes.\n\nMake sure you share with your brothers.\n\nThanks, mom.\n\nDon't look at your feet.\n\nDon't look at your feet. Look at the road.\n\nLook at the road. Good.\n\nOw. Okay. Find your balance.\n\nFind your balance. Okay, it's all you.\n\nIt's all you! You're doing great!\n\nOkay, stay to the right.\n\nWatch the car.\n\nWatch the car!\n\nWatch the car!\n\nOh, god.\n\nOh! Are you okay?\n\nYeah. Let's go again.\n\nOh, honey, these heels don't have another block in them.\n\nWhat about tomorrow?\n\nWell, you won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school.\n\nI'm homeschooled. I'm always around.\n\nIt was in that moment that Gabrielle realized this ride was far from over.\n\nSusan: I'm coming!\n\nCarl, what are you doing here? I asked you to come tomorrow.\n\nYou said you wanted to talk. It sounded important.\n\nTomorrow. I'm in a towel.\n\nWe were married 14 years. I know what's under there.\n\nCome on.\n\nI'm not really ready for this.\n\nI was going to have a whole speech prepared.\n\nBrandy and I have plans tomorrow.\n\nI suggest you wing it.\n\nOh...\n\nUm, okay.\n\nHere's the thing, Carl...\n\nI was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday, and...\n\nI-I just don't want to... I don't want to live like that.\n\nI don't want to be that kind of person, and I just thought if the two of us, you know, if we had a nice, calm...\n\nI need an apology, Carl.\n\nA what?\n\nAn apology for the way you ended our marriage.\n\nYou never took any responsibility for your behavior.\n\nHa ha.\n\nI don't know what to say, Susan.\n\nThe heart wants what it wants.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nI fell in love.\n\nWhile you were married to someone else.\n\nThe heart wants what it wants.\n\nWell, my heart wants to hurt you, but I can control myself.\n\nI-I don't want to go back to that ugly place, really, and if you do, I suggest that you get some help.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI don't need an apology. I don't need anything from you.\n\nYou're humiliating yourself.\n\nNo, you're the one who's been humiliated, Carl.\n\nWhy don't you see that?\n\nYou walked out on your family.\n\nPeople think you're scum, not me, so worry about yourself. I'm okay with me.\n\nI can walk down the street and hold my head high.\n\nMary Alice: As the sun slowly settled on Wisteria Lane, an unsettled Susan racked her brain to find a way into her own house.\n\nAah!\n\nLying naked in the bush, it occurred to Susan this could very well be the most humiliating moment of her life.\n\nSusan?\n\nShe was wrong.\n\nUh, whatcha doing?\n\nLocked myself out...\n\nNaked.\n\nOh.\n\nAnd then I fell.\n\nSo how are you?\n\nGood, good.\n\nI just got back. I've been gone all day, and I got your messages about dinner, and, um, I would love to come if that invite still stands.\n\nIt's a date.\n\nAll right. I, um...\n\nAssume the dress is casual.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt's casual.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nThanks for helping me break in.\n\nDo you think it'll be hard to replace that screen?\n\nIt depends. If you're going to nail it in yourself, you might want to wear gloves...\n\nOr pants.\n\nPants wouldn't hurt.\n\nOkay, I know what just happened is funny in theory, but I'm nowhere near ready to laugh about it, so please, no jokes.\n\nHey, where have you two been?\n\nUh, Susan had a problem finding something to wear.\n\nOh, is that the kind of thing you meant?\n\nPretty much.\n\nThe kids are bouncing off the walls? Huh.\n\nWell, I'm sure you can figure a way to put them to bed, Tom.\n\nI mean, for god's sakes, Tom, they're just kids.\n\nHey. Are you okay?\n\nYes, I-I went jogging today, and I think I just pushed myself too hard.\n\nOh, you're probably not wearing the right shoes.\n\nYeah, that thought did cross my mind.\n\nSo Gabrielle says that you and Bree are taking lessons three times a week. Uh-huh.\n\nI'm actually thinking about playing again.\n\nI mean, it's such great exercise.\n\nMm. That it is.\n\nAnd my drop shot could use a serious tune-up.\n\nThink you can give me the number of your pro?\n\nYeah. I'll, uh, I'll give it to you later.\n\nWell, what club does he work out of?\n\nUm...\n\nW-We're not really taking tennis lessons, Carlos.\n\nYou're not?\n\nThat's a story Bree concocted to cover the fact that we're seeing a marriage counselor.\n\nBree... Bree...\n\nHe wouldn't stop asking about the tennis pro.\n\nBree and I are in marriage counseling.\n\nEveryone knows our secret now.\n\nDid the sky fall?\n\nHas your life come crashing down?\n\nIf everybody would please take your seats, dinner is served.\n\nA grisly discovery was made today in westbrook when a chest was found in rockwater lake, discovered by a local area businessman and his grandson while they were fishing.\n\nOkay, I got to break the ice here.\n\nSo you're in counseling. Big deal.\n\nYou want humiliation? I'll give you humiliation.\n\nI locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by Mike.\n\nOh, my god. When did this happen?\n\nToday, right before the party.\n\nWhat can I say? Right place, right time.\n\nI think I can top that.\n\nTry getting thrown out of Disneyland for lewd behavior.\n\nWhat? When was this?\n\nWhen Tom and I were first married, things got a little out of hand on Mr. Toad's wild ride.\n\nYou're kidding. No.\n\nWe got perp walked down main street, usa.\n\nWell, since we're doing true confessions, Carlos and I once broke a waterbed in canc\u00fan. How'd you manage that?\n\nWell, he used to have a thing for spiked heels.\n\nI'd just like to make it clear...\n\nShewas wearing them.\n\nRex cries after he ejaculates.\n\nYou think we left too early?\n\nI was thinking we left too late.\n\nHa ha.\n\nSo is, uh, Rex gone for good?\n\nI don't know.\n\nGod, I hope not.\n\nI mean, they've always been wound a little tight, but I've never seen them like that.\n\nThen again, who am I to judge?\n\nYou mean people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw soda cans?\n\nOkay, you have got to know that I only get that angry around Carl.\n\nHe just treated me so badly at the end.\n\nI haven't been able to get past it.\n\nWell, maybe he did you a big favor.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nLet's look at Carl as a starter marriage...\n\nYou know, boot camp.\n\nPreparing you for something better next time.\n\nListen, Mike...\n\nAbout the whole seeing me naked thing, I...\n\nI don't... I just want to thank you for being such a...\n\nPerfect gentleman.\n\nOh, I wasn't a perfect gentleman.\n\nI might have snuck a peek.\n\nOh.\n\nGood night.\n\nAnd, um, for what it's worth...\n\nWow.\n\nHi.\n\nHow was your night?\n\nWe are raising little terrorists.\n\nYou know that, don't you?\n\nOh. You didn't have a good time?\n\nOkay, you know what? Drop the act.\n\nI know you gave them cookies.\n\nOh. Who cracked?\n\nHa ha.\n\nPorter.\n\nOh.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo how was your, uh, dinner party?\n\nWell, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party.\n\nUh-oh. What happened?\n\nI don't know.\n\nRex announced that he and Bree are in counseling.\n\nShe retaliated with this whole revelation which I won't even go into now, and the bottom line is he stormed out.\n\nClearly, there's trouble in paradise.\n\nWell, honestly, I'm not that surprised.\n\nWhy not? I don't know.\n\nI just never got the idea that they were really happy.\n\nAre we happy?\n\nMan, oh, man.\n\nI keep seeing that look on Rex's face, and then him taking off like that.\n\nHa ha.\n\nSome night.\n\nThen again, I would probably cry, too, if I had to have sex with that woman.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nI mean, you watch a man get torn down like that, it makes you wonder why he let her get away with it.\n\nBelieve me, if a woman ever humiliated me like that in public, hmm... it would only happen once.\n\nSo, uh, where are you going?\n\nI'll be staying at the motor lodge.\n\nThe hotel by the interstate has better rates, and it's closer to your work.\n\nFine.\n\nI'm packing your swimsuit.\n\nThere's a pool there, and I know how swimming relaxes you.\n\nWhen our kids ask where I am, what are you going to say?\n\nUm...\n\nI could tell them that you went to tennis camp.\n\nThat was a joke.\n\nYeah. I got it.\n\nAh. There.\n\nObviously, if you've forgotten anything, you can, um, come right back and get it.\n\nWell, I'll call you.\n\nRex.\n\nIn college, when we first started dating, people were so jealous of us.\n\nWe were the golden couple.\n\nEverybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nBecause you can't even let me pack my own suitcase.\n\nAhem.\n\nAll right, see ya.\n\nHave fun.\n\nHey. Where are you going?\n\nJust a sec.\n\nMom?\n\nDon't worry. I'm not packing heat.\n\nHey, Brandy, would you scoot a little?\n\nJust scoot. Thank you.\n\nHi.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI'll be quick.\n\nBrandy, I'm sorry for the way I treated you.\n\nIt was uncalled for and childish, and it won't happen again.\n\nI have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you, and I realize now that I just can't carry that around anymore, so apology or no apology, I'm moving on.\n\nMrs. Mayer?\n\nBrandy.\n\nBrandy, get in the car. Mrs. Mayer.\n\nPlease, call me Susan.\n\nI just wanted you to know what happened between me and Carl, things got out of hand because I thought your marriage was over.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted you to know I'm sorry. I really am.\n\nThank you.\n\nMary Alice: And though it came from an unexpected source, Susan finally got the apology she'd always wanted.\n\nHey.\n\nLet me take those.\n\nYou're wearing a really big hat.\n\nYes, I am.\n\nListen, the kids are watching a video, which means that we've got only about 45 minutes until they actually find Nemo, so I suggest that we make the most of it.\n\nBy reliving your night out with the guys?\n\nLynette...\n\nI'm trying.\n\nYou look...\n\nRidiculous in that thing.\n\nSexy ridiculous?\n\nMaybe.\n\nHa ha ha.\n\nI can live...\n\nWith maybe.\n\nOh.\n\nYou know, it's going to take more than just this one night.\n\nI know.\n\nAh.\n\nLooks like we have an audience.\n\nHa ha.\n\nLet 'em look.\n\nAs long as they don't try and cut in.\n\nDr. Goldfine.\n\nBree. We're not scheduled now, are we?\n\nI didn't have time to make an appointment.\n\nRex moved out today.\n\nOh, I'm very sorry to hear that, but unfortunately, I'm completely booked right now.\n\nI don't need much time. It just seems that you have more insight into my situation than I do, and I just think...\n\nBree, we can't talk now.\n\nIf you could just tell me what he told you, then I could fix the problem.\n\nI can't do that. It's completely unethical.\n\nWell, why can't you...\n\nThat's my next appointment.\n\nYou really need to go.\n\nDr. Goldfine, please.\n\nHold on. I'll go and talk to my client.\n\nDr. Goldfine: I understand completely.\n\nI'll... I'll be out in just a minute.\n\nBree, I'm... I'm sorry. He can't wait, but I can see you first thing in the morning... -00.\n\n8:00.\n\nSorry to interrupt.\n\nBye.\n\nYes, I remember the world.\n\nWhat I remember most is how afraid I was.\n\nWhat a waste.\n\nYou see, to live in fear is not to live at all.\n\nI wish I could tell this to those I left behind...\n\nBut would it do any good?\n\nYes, there will always be those who face their fears...\n\nAnd there will always be those who run away.",
    "It's beginning to look a lot like the iPhone is doomed\nIt\u2019s beginning to look a lot like the iPhone is doomed\nIt's that time of year again!\n\nHappy Cutmas, everyone!\n\nYes, it\u2019s that time of year again as Bloomberg (the outfit that ran the highly refuted story \u201cThe Big Hack\u201d) is here to remind us to put some cookie cutters out for Father Cutmas.\n\nOkay, well, surprise, we get these stories every year because sales naturally fall after the big fall release. This time it comes with some added global supply chain garment-rending so let\u2019s see if we can follow the logic here. Without taking any dangerous drugs.\n\nApple Inc., suffering from a global supply crunch, is now confronting a different problem: slowing demand.\n\nNobody wants iPhones!\n\n\u2026signaling that some consumers have decided against trying to get the hard-to-find item.\n\nWe\u2019re in the second sentence and we\u2019ve already careened off Making Sense Blvd., busted through the guardrails and exploded spectacularly over What The Actual Heck Ravine.\n\nNo one is buying the phones that Apple cannot make enough of to keep up with demand.\n\nIf you wondered why the Macalope drinks\u2026 [points accusingly at the quoted sentences above]\u2026 this. This is why. Right here. This stuff.\n\nAlready, Apple had cut its iPhone 13 production goal for this year by as many as 10 million units, down from a target of 90 million\u2026\n\nSo, according to this math, Apple was planning on selling about 80 million units of just the iPhone 13. That\u2019s kind of a lot of units.\n\nThe company is still on track for a record holiday season\u2026\n\nMacalope\nIDG\n\nNobody wants iPhones. Apple records record holiday season. That\u2026 you just\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 why\u2026\n\nApparently the idea here is that Apple is still going to sell gobs of iPhones, it just isn\u2019t going to sell the huge gobs that it thought it was going to sell. We know this because Apple is such an open book. And how Apple can be facing \u201cslowing demand\u201d when it already can\u2019t keep up with the current demand is beyond this furry observer.\n\nLong story short, Apple\u2019s clearly the biggest loser in all of Loserville. So who\u2019s winning?\n\nHuge quarter for foldable phones! Unbelievable! Just mind-bogglingly large! How big is the winning, you ask? Oh, well, why get into the minutia when it\u2019s all right there in the head-\n\nQ3\u201921 foldable smartphone shipments were larger than the previous four quarters combined and grew 215% Q/Q and 480% Y/Y\u2026\n\nWow! Well, that\u2019s all you need to know, then. Case closed. Big winning. Guess we can just close this tab and go back to watching ASMR TikTok videos with the sound off and\u2026\n\n\u2026to 2.6M phones.\n\nWait, what?\n\nYes, the entirety of the foldable phone market is practically a rounding error for Apple. And even at that low level, it\u2019s larger than the previous four quarters combined. Why are we even talking about this? Analysts have been saying that Apple better get on the foldable phone bandwagon (disclaimer: no band, no wagon) quick or BE DOOMED as long ago as 2012. Nine years later, the entire market is maybe 3.5 percent of Apple\u2019s quarterly sales.\n\nIt is possible Apple might not ship as many phones as it expected. But that\u2019s a number no one really knows, even the company\u2019s suppliers. The Macalope must insist that people chillax themselves before they must ax themselves what they\u2019re so worked up about.\n\nIn addition to being a mythical beast, the Macalope is not an employee of Macworld. As a result, the Macalope is always free to criticize any media organization. Even ours.",
    "Eli scruggs was the handiest of all handymen.\n\nYou could ask any of his customers, and they would tell you, there was nothing he couldn't fix.\n\nWhether it was a broken vase...\n\nA leaky pipe...\n\nOr a shaky banister, Eli always knew how to get the job done.\n\nBut sadly, the man who had fixed so many things for the residents of Wisteria Lane was now about to break their hearts.\n\nEli Scruggs, get down from there!\n\nMrs. McCluskey.\n\nJust found this note in my mailbox.\n\nSays you're retiring? What the hell?\n\nYes, ma'am. It's true.\n\nNow why would you want to do something stupid like that?\n\nMy doc says I got a bum ticker, have to take it easy from now on.\n\nWell, once I'm done fixing Mrs. Mayer's shingle, I'm on a plane to waikiki. Well, this is very annoying.\n\nWho's gonna fix my water heater when it breaks?\n\nOh, I met this young guy named Toby.\n\nVery bright, just turned 30. He'll take care of you.\n\nAh, damn it, Eli!\n\nI am not comfortable with strangers in my house.\n\nTook me ten years to trust you. I know.\n\nMost of those guys leave tools and nails all over the place.\n\nYou never leave a mess.\n\nThank you, ma'am.\n\nHave you told everyone else you're leaving?\n\nI left copies of that same note in everybody's mailbox.\n\nWell, that's not right.\n\nAfter all these years, people will want to say good-bye, and... you know, maybe throw you a party or somethin'.\n\nOh, no. I prefer to go quietly, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't want a big fuss.\n\nWell, I'll miss you, Eli.\n\nThere will never be another one like you.\n\nWith that, Eli scruggs climbed his ladder for the very last time.\n\nAnd once he had finished making his last repair, Eli scruggs... Quietly, with no fuss...\n\nHad a heart attack and died.\n\nAnd most importantly...\n\nWithout leaving a mess.\n\nIt took an hour for someone to finally notice the body laying atop Susan Mayer's roof.\n\nAah!\n\nIt was less than ten minutes later that the neighbors began arriving, each determined to get a look at the various paramedics and policemen who were all frantically trying to figure out exactly how to bring the body down.\n\nAnd it took two days for my friends to realize this tragedy had affected them...\n\nWe're ready! Come on.\n\nMore than they were willing to admit.\n\nHey, Gaby, did you remember to get change?\n\n'Cause when I cash in my chips, I don't want to hear you say, \"all I've got is $50s.\" Speaking of cashing in your chips, anyone know when Eli's funeral is? Oh, I think it's Saturday.\n\nI wonder how many people are gonna show up.\n\nMrs. McCluskey was saying he didn't have much family. Poor Eli. We should make sure he's got flowers at his funeral.\n\nI'm in. How much are we talking?\n\nI don't know. What do you think, Gaby?\n\nGaby?\n\nWow! Jimmy choo!\n\nOh, Carlos!\n\nThese aren't even in the states yet.\n\nWhat's the catch?\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nYou never buy me a present unless I'm mad or about to be mad.\n\nAnd I don't think I am, so why am I about to be?\n\nI have to go to Cleveland tomorrow. Carlos!\n\nThey're begging me. The merger's going south. You just got home!\n\nWith shoes.\n\nDon't leave me here. I'm going out of my mind.\n\nEveryone is so boring and suburban.\n\nAnd how many freakin' honor students can that school have?\n\nCan we please not argue in front of the handyman? He has a name.\n\nWhat's your name?\n\nEli scruggs.\n\nYou hear that, Carlos?\n\nYou've brought me to a place where people are named \"Eli scruggs.\"\n\nFine. I'll give up my job...\n\nAnd everything that comes with it.\n\nNot the Jimmy choos.\n\nThey're the only friends I've got.\n\nThought so.\n\nI'm going to pack.\n\nYou know, it's none of my business...\n\nYou're right. It's not.\n\nBut the ladies in this neighborhood are actually pretty nice. Yeah. They came by, brought muffins.\n\nOne of 'em wants her basket back.\n\nThat'd be Bree.\n\nAnyhow, she and the other ladies, uh, play poker every week.\n\nIf you'd like, I could talk to 'em, see if they'll let you host a game.\n\nHi. We're, um... The neighborhood.\n\nGabrielle invited us to play poker.\n\nSo... is she in?\n\nMrs. Solis will be right down.\n\nShe likes to make an entrance.\n\nWhat does that mean, \"an entrance\"?\n\nHello there.\n\nWelcome to my home.\n\nOh.\n\nThat's what it means.\n\nSo I said, \"pumpkin\"...\n\nThat's what I call Jon bon jovi...\n\nI said, \"pumpkin, even if I could steer a yacht, I'm certainly not about to do it in 5-inch heels.\"\n\nTrue story.\n\nWell, you've certainly had quite a glamorous life.\n\nWell, it was before my husband moved me here to east nowhere.\n\nSeriously, I don't know how you girls do it.\n\nDo what? Get out of bed in the morning.\n\nI've only lived here a month, and I want to put a gun to my head.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nNo, we don't. There are no good nightclubs, no theater.\n\nWhat do you do for a good time?\n\nWell, we watch the kids play soccer.\n\nAnd the school drama department puts on some really great shows.\n\nAnd then there's church, of course.\n\nChurch.\n\nOh, you're serious.\n\nLook, I know it's quiet here, but I think you'll find there's a real charm to Fairview.\n\nNo, no, it's cute. It's cute. I get that.\n\nIt's just...\n\nI was a top-tier fashion model, and I guess I'm just gonna have to get used to the fact that the best part of my life is behind me.\n\nGood-bye doing vodka shots with Kate moss, and hello to sipping international coffee with you girls.\n\nFull house.\n\nYes?\n\nHello. Is Mrs. Solis here?\n\nOh, I got it. I got it. Go, go, go, go, go.\n\nMa'am, here's the bill for fixing your sink. Okay. Thank you.\n\nBy the way...\n\nYou made quite an impression at the poker game.\n\nReally? Oh, yeah. The ladies can't stop talking about you.\n\nAw. Well, I'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a star in their midst.\n\nUh, let me think... Did they say \"star\"?\n\nI heard, uh, \"stuck-up,\" \"obnoxious,\" \"bitch.\"\n\nWhat?!\n\nYou know, I went out on a limb to get you into that game, and then you go in there acting like you're better than they are. Oh, my clothes said that, not me.\n\nWell, did you ask them anything about their lives? Why would they want to talk about their lives?\n\nTheir lives are boring.\n\nWell, you know what's gonna be really boring?\n\nYou sitting here alone in this big house without any friends.\n\nIf I were you, I'd drop the attitude.\n\nLearn to like your neighbors.\n\nWell, thanks for the advice.\n\nYou wanna add that to your bill?\n\nNo. It's on the house.\n\nI brought muffins.\n\nThat's so nice.\n\nWe were just...\n\nPlaying poker, and I wasn't invited.\n\nI know. I get it.\n\nI just wanted to tell you guys I know I made a horrible first impression.\n\nNow you know why models don't usually talk.\n\nBecause we say a lot of stupid, patronizing things that make people want to avoid us.\n\nWhat I should've said was... My husband's never home.\n\nI miss the city.\n\nI miss my life.\n\nI'm lonely all the time...\n\nAnd I could really use some friends.\n\nAnyway, here.\n\nNow that's how you make an entrance.\n\nGaby?\n\nI'm sorry. What?\n\nWe're getting a wreath for Eli's funeral. Are you in?\n\nActually, why don't you let me pay for it?\n\nIt can still be from all of us. No, you don't have to do that.\n\nI sort of do.\n\nNow let's play some poker.\n\nAll right, time for my luck to change.\n\nThis hand is for Eli.\n\nHmm. Next hand is for Eli.\n\nYou know, if we're gonna have a get-together after the funeral, we should start thinking about food.\n\nAnd by \"we\" and \"food,\" you mean Bree, right? I thought that was clear.\n\nI'd be happy to. Any special requests?\n\nHow about we pick something from your cookbook?\n\nGreat. Gaby, do you have your copy?\n\nI'll go get it.\n\nYou use my cookbook to balance your table?\n\nOh, it's only temporary.\n\nJuanita needed her coloring book back.\n\nOh. All right.\n\nWatch out, ladies.\n\nI'm sorry if the frittata is a bit dry.\n\nAre you kidding? It's great.\n\nYou should give Lynette the recipe. Yes, 'cause that's what women in their eighth month really crave... more stove time. Mine is so erratic.\n\nI'm not even sure what the real temperature is.\n\nOf course, if a certain doctor would loosen the purse strings... We're not getting a new stove.\n\nIf you would just take on a few more patients, we could afford it. Well, if I'm not supporting you adequately, my dear, by all means, feel free to do something about it. Such as?\n\nWell, you could maybe... I don't know, get a job?\n\nI have a job. I'm a homemaker.\n\nAnd a damn good one. So to make this, you... you just s-saut\u00e9 some ham and some onions... it's not happening, Tom.\n\nI just sometimes think maybe you would appreciate the value of a dollar more if you had to work outside the home.\n\nAnd I think you would appreciate my value more if, for once, you had to cook your own food and wash your own clothes.\n\nLynette makes me sew my own buttons. I'll sew anything you want if you just stop getting me pregnant.\n\nI want a new stove, Rex, and if I need to get a job to pay for it, so be it.\n\nIf you're looking for a stove, we've got one that's hardly ever been used.\n\nI wish I could say the same for my uterus.\n\nOh, yeah. I ruined the brunch.\n\nHey, how's it looking under there, Eli?\n\nIs it gonna cost me an arm and a leg?\n\nNah. A few fingers, maybe.\n\nHoney, my stomach's growling. When's dinner?\n\nOh, we're having leftovers.\n\nYou can heat them up yourself if you want.\n\nSince when do we have leftovers?\n\nSince I started writing my own cookbook.\n\nRemember how you told me I should start making my own money?\n\nWell, I've been going through all my old recipes, and I've got this great idea for a real home-style American cookbook. You're not serious?\n\nWhy wouldn't I be?\n\nPeople are always complimenting me on my cooking. You're great, but come on.\n\nEvery bored housewife who pulls off a decent lasagne thinks she can write a cookbook.\n\nYou think I'm just like every other housewife?\n\nNo. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. It's just that...\n\nWhat do you really know about writing?\n\nI'll learn. And I want it to be more than just a cookbook.\n\nI want to talk about traditional values and give helpful hints about homemaking.\n\nLook, look, this is my fault.\n\nYou know, I-I was ribbing you the other day about getting a job, but you took it seriously.\n\nIf you really want a new stove, I'll get you a stove.\n\nNow can you stop this foolishness and make me something to eat that isn't leftovers?\n\nMrs. Van De Kamp?\n\nI fixed your banister. Should be fine now.\n\nI'll just go. You can pay me whenever.\n\nI know this is a rough time for you.\n\nThanks, Eli.\n\nBy the way, the service for Mr. V. Was really nice.\n\nYou were there?\n\nI sat in the back of the church.\n\nI wanted to say good-bye to Mr. V.\n\nSo, uh...\n\nHave you thought about what you're gonna do now?\n\nYou mean, with my life?\n\nI don't know.\n\nMrs. V...\n\nI've been meaning to give this to you for a while now...\n\nBut I, uh, could never find the right moment.\n\nI kept it for you, just in case you might need it someday.\n\nHope you don't mind.\n\nOh, I gotta tell you. I made your cajun meatloaf.\n\nWhoo!\n\nThat may be my favorite meal ever.\n\nI can't believe you saved this.\n\nAh.\n\nOf course, I'm not really in the mood to write a cookbook right now.\n\nWell...\n\nMaybe one day you will be.\n\nHey, Bree, I know what you can make for the wake...\n\nThat flaky-breaded-shrimp thing.\n\nThanks, but I know exactly what I'm gonna make.\n\nDave, it was a nice trip, but I gotta tell you, I don't know why we spent all that money going to The Bahamas.\n\nIf we're not gonna leave the hotel room, then why not just cover ourselves in suntan lotion and have sex here?\n\nYou just got a message from Mrs. McCluskey.\n\nOh?\n\nShe said your handyman died.\n\nEli?\n\nOh, my god.\n\nHe was working on Susan's roof and dropped dead of a heart attack.\n\nCan you believe that?\n\nNo, no, no. You are not going to the gym again.\n\nYou said we were gonna have afternoon sex.\n\nWe'll do it when I get back. You say that every time, umberto, and then you're too tired. Maybe I wouldn't be if you weren't so clingy.\n\nClingy?\n\nWe haven't had sex in two weeks.\n\nIt's like I'm 15 again.\n\nWhat's wrong with us?\n\nNot us. You.\n\nYour libido is out of control.\n\nUmberto...\n\nLook, you've got a drawerful of toys. Use 'em.\n\nOh!\n\nAhem.\n\nOh!\n\nOh! Eli! I-I forgot you were in there.\n\nYeah. I'm done fixing your faucet.\n\nActually, I was done ten minutes ago, but I was afraid to come out. I'm sorry you heard all of that.\n\nThe good news is, while I was in there, I re-grouted your tub... Free of charge.\n\nWait a second.\n\nWhat do you think of my ass?\n\nSorry?\n\nMy ass... On a scale from one to ten.\n\nWell, i-i-i, uh...\n\nTicktock.\n\nTen. It's a ten.\n\nAnd the boobs? Perky and firm?\n\nYou've named them?\n\nOh, come on, Eli.\n\nMy husband won't have sex with me.\n\nI just need to make sure it's not... me.\n\nIt's not you.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nTrust me. I used to work in construction.\n\nMy buddies would've gone crazy for you...\n\nCatcalls, uh, nasty gestures.\n\n\"Hey, you, with the sweater meats!\n\n\"If you ever need any work done, call me!\n\n'Cause I got the perfect tool for the job!\"\n\nY-you get the drift.\n\nYeah. I do.\n\nThat was insulting and demeaning.\n\nOh.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nMiss Britt?\n\nThe door was wide open.\n\nI got the paint. You want to check the color? Eh.\n\nIs everything okay?\n\nThings are great.\n\nYou want some wine?\n\nWe're celebrating.\n\nWhat's the occasion?\n\nI am no longer married to a gay guy.\n\nUmberto was gay?\n\nSo you wasted your time installing that light in the closet, because... He went flying out of there.\n\nAt least you know now it wasn't you.\n\nWasn't it?\n\nHe said that being married to me was what convinced him that he liked men.\n\nOh. You could imagine what a boost to the ego that was.\n\nCome on.\n\nYou had a gay guy sleeping with you for two years, and those guys are pretty hard to land.\n\nNo. No, trust me.\n\nNo need to be sad.\n\nYou're a knockout.\n\nNo, I-I-I need this hand back.\n\nIt's hard to be a handyman without a-a hand.\n\nMm.\n\nMiss Britt, what are you doing?\n\nYou put the mirror over my bed.\n\nYou know exactly what I'm doing.\n\nAre you sure about this? I don't want to take advantage of you.\n\nOh, I'm sure you'll be gentle.\n\nAnyway, I guess they're burying him on Saturday.\n\nObviously, you want to go.\n\nYeah.\n\nI do.\n\nOh, leave that black dress out.\n\nI'll get it dry-cleaned for the funeral.\n\nA little sexy for a funeral, isn't it?\n\nOh, I don't think Eli would mind.\n\nMom?\n\nThat's penny. I'll be right back.\n\nMom!\n\nHey, sweetie.\n\nWhat's up?\n\nYou said you would help me with my math.\n\nWe're dividing fractions.\n\nOh. I wish you'd caught me two chardonnays ago.\n\nMom, you promised.\n\nI know, but mommy's still planning Eli's memorial.\n\nStart without me.\n\nI'll be there in a little while.\n\nOh, my gosh. Lynette, are you okay?\n\nThe doctor just called. I'm pregnant.\n\nThis is fantastic!\n\nYou...\n\nYeah. Whoop-Dee-doo.\n\nHoney, you don't sound too happy about this.\n\nI was planning to go back to work.\n\nWhat? What a... What are you talking about?\n\nI had it in the back of my mind for a while, and then yesterday, I got a ph... hold it.\n\nSorry. I was having trouble paying attention.\n\nJeffrey cuevas is retiring in September.\n\nI am the perfect person to step into his job, and that is exactly when Parker starts kindergarten.\n\nThe timing is like a dream.\n\nBut what about our dream of having a-a little girl?\n\nThis could be our chance.\n\nOh, please. You know it's gonna be a boy. It's always a boy.\n\nIt's just gonna pee in my face and hide dead things in my shoes.\n\nI am doing this, Tom.\n\nI am going after this job.\n\nBut who's gonna take care of the kids?\n\nWell, I was hoping you could cut back on your hours at work.\n\nI can't do that.\n\nI have a career.\n\nYou did not just say that.\n\nNo, I-I didn't. I didn't.\n\nTom, I cannot just stay at home wiping noses.\n\nI need it for my sanity, and I need you to back me up.\n\nOh!\n\nMom?\n\nWell, the kids are up.\n\nThey're gonna want their breakfast.\n\nAnd I'm gonna back you up by, uh, making it for 'em.\n\nMy hero.\n\nJeff cuevas is fantastic, but I know I could take his department to a whole new level.\n\nWhat the hell is that?\n\nOh, my water broke.\n\nTake the overnight bag out to the car.\n\nOh, three weeks.\n\nThat's a little soon, but, uh, sure, I could make that work.\n\nFor god sakes, Lynette, we gotta go to the hospital. In a minute. I'm trying to lock this job down.\n\nWhat kind of perks are we talking about here?\n\nOkay, you're having contractions. That's it. You...\n\nI swear, if you touch this phone, I will have this baby right here and then beat you with it!\n\nYou're insane. We have to go.\n\nCould you hold on one second?\n\nWe agreed I could go back to work after I gave birth. After, Lynette, not during!\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nIs there any way we could finish this conversation tomorrow?\n\nOh!\n\nL-L-Later in the day works better for me, too.\n\nWell, thank you very much.\n\nBye. Hey. Whew! I got the job!\n\nCongratulations. The baby's arm is sticking out.\n\nWhy don't you high-five it?\n\nTom, I am in pain. Do you mind?\n\nOh.\n\nYou'll see, Tom.\n\nI know. People say that you... ooh!\n\nYou can't have it all, but I know we can.\n\nOh, Mr. Swenson, I can't tell you how excited I am.\n\nMaybe you could schedule a staff meeting so I could hit the ground running on Monday.\n\nNo, no.\n\nNo, it can't be Friday, because, remember, we agreed that we would start next week?\n\nSo again, thank you so much for this opportunity.\n\nMrs. Scavo? Yeah?\n\nI think you might have forgotten somethin'.\n\nCould you hold on a second?\n\nOh, my god.\n\nOh, my god.\n\nShe's fine.\n\nI was on the phone.\n\nI was talking to my new boss, and I... She was only in there for a minute.\n\nBut it's 85 degrees outside. I've never done this before.\n\nYou got a lot on your mind... Three kids and a newborn, it sounds like a new job.\n\nYeah, I do.\n\nYeah. It's a lot to handle.\n\nThere you go.\n\nMm.\n\nI should probably get back to Susan's windows.\n\nUh, you take care.\n\nLynette, are you still there?\n\nLynette?\n\nHello?\n\nAre you still there?\n\nHey. You coming back in?\n\nNo.\n\nI'm gonna go help my daughter with her homework.\n\nHey, penny! Wait up!\n\nUgh.\n\nYard sale!\n\nOh! Good. You're here.\n\nHow are you, Eli?\n\nFine. You?\n\nGreat. Yeah, I haven't worn these jeans in a while, and I found 20 bucks in the pocket.\n\nDon't you just love when that happens?\n\nAlso, Karl left me for his secretary, so I need you to change these locks.\n\nOh, I'm so sorry.\n\nOh, thanks, but don't be. Just hurry.\n\nKarl said he was coming by to get some of his stuff, and I want this place to be a fortress by then.\n\nYou're doing all right, though?\n\nOh, well, on one hand, I got dumped for a pair of headlights named Brandy.\n\nOn the other, I reported Karl's credit cards stolen, and I cut the pockets out of all of his pants.\n\nSo a little from column \"a,\" a little from column \"b.\"\n\nOh. Sorry.\n\nWell, if it's any consolation, redheads are nuts.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThat she'll make his life a living hell.\n\nIt sounds like what he deserves.\n\nBrandy's not a redhead. She's blonde.\n\nSo, uh, you maybe want to go with a dead bolt this time?\n\nWhat... do... you... know?\n\nI saw him around town a couple times with a redhead.\n\nUh, people in the neighborhood were talking.\n\nI-I thought you knew.\n\nI didn't.\n\nWould you feel any better knowing that, uh, she's kinda chubby?\n\nJust leave!\n\nBut what... But what about the locks?\n\nI-I-If Karl's coming...\n\nChange the locks, then leave.\n\nOkay, but I really am sorry...\n\nChange the locks, don't talk to me, then leave.\n\nSusan?\n\nSusan, did you call me?\n\nI couldn't really understand the message.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nYou want me to come back later?\n\nAre you all right?\n\nNo. Of course you're not.\n\nI heard you and Mike are getting divorced.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nProbably not what you want to hear, but I thought you were a great couple.\n\nThanks.\n\nSweet.\n\nDo you... maybe you remember what you wanted me to do?\n\nLocks.\n\nChange the locks. Got it.\n\nLet me go see what I got out in the truck.\n\nSusan...\n\nI don't know much about love.\n\nI... I dabbled in it once or twice, but it always seemed more trouble than it was worth.\n\nI told myself I wasn't missing much.\n\nBut watching you all these years, how... How hard you've tried, how...\n\nHow hurt you've been, but you still...\n\nKeep getting back up, you dust yourself off, then you try again.\n\nMaybe I am...\n\nMissing something.\n\nMaybe...\n\nMaybe it is worth it.\n\nAnd, um, I'm sure it's not gonna help for you to hear me tell you this, but you're damn heroic to me.\n\nYou are.\n\nYeah.\n\nHey. Just dropping these off. I finally got 'em cut.\n\nTell Jackson I'm sorry it took me so long.\n\nActually, um...\n\nJackson and I split up.\n\nWow. I'm sorry.\n\nAm I sorry?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nHe's a great guy.\n\nI just, uh, want to be alone right now.\n\nWell, good for you.\n\nOh, hey. Mm?\n\nAs long as you're here, I think there's a loose shingle on my roof.\n\nDo you think maybe you could fix it for me?\n\nOh, I'd be happy to.\n\nBut just so you know, it'll be the last thing I ever fix for you. I'm retiring.\n\nWhat?\n\nToday's my last day.\n\nYou can't retire. I break too many things.\n\nI know. You paid for the trip to Hawaii I'm gonna take.\n\nNo, it's the right move. Be happy for me.\n\nHey, I am happy for you.\n\nIt's just, uh...\n\nThis is gonna sound crazy.\n\nWhat?\n\nUm, I think you have been the most consistent male relationship in my life.\n\nYou're so stable and reliable, and I just...\n\nAlways thought you'd be around.\n\nWhich is funny, because I don't really know anything about you.\n\nWell, how about this... I fix your shingle, and when I'm done, you can ask me anything you want.\n\nGreat.\n\nI will go to the store right now and get some wine so we can toast your retirement.\n\nI like that. Perfect way to end my time on Wisteria Lane.\n\nOh, hey.\n\nWhat kind do you like... Red or white?\n\nEither one. Just make sure it's a screw top.\n\nEli scruggs was buried on a Saturday...\n\nAnd all the people that Eli had helped over the years came to pay their last respects.\n\nBut one person was missing...\n\nSomeone who had changed Eli's life...\n\nIn a way he never forgot.\n\nExcuse me, ma'am.\n\nHope I'm not interrupting your day.\n\nNot at all. Can I help you?\n\nI was hoping I could help you. I'm a handyman.\n\nJust moved into town. Looking for work.\n\nSorry. I, um, I don't have anything that needs fixing.\n\nWell, if you ever do, uh, here's my card.\n\n\"Eli scruggs.\"\n\nWhat a distinctive name.\n\nPeople do seem to remember it.\n\nSo if any of your friends, uh, need help, I can do pretty much anything. I don't know. Um...\n\nIf you have a extra card or two, I-I could hand them out.\n\nOh, I'd really appreciate that.\n\nOh. Oh.\n\nAnyway...\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nI have a broken vase.\n\nI'm sorry?\n\nI-I was, uh, dusting the other day and knocked it off the bureau, like an idiot.\n\nAnyway, I saved the pieces.\n\nIf you could glue it back together for me, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nOh, ma'am, you don't have to do that.\n\nMr. Scruggs, I need my vase fixed.\n\nIt means a lot to me.\n\nNow you're not gonna make me beg, are you?\n\nNo, ma'am, I'm not.\n\nGood.\n\nCome on in.\n\nMrs. Young?\n\nOh. Didn't mean to disturb you.\n\nYour front door was wide open.\n\nOh.\n\nEli, I-I don't have any work for you today.\n\nI'm just here to drop off that handle you wanted.\n\nFinally found one that matched. Want me to install it?\n\nNot today.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll just be going then.\n\nEli, wait.\n\nWhat?\n\nDo you remember this?\n\nOh, right. This is the very first thing you ever fixed for me.\n\nYeah, that must have been what, uh, two years ago? Yeah.\n\nI just that glue really held, huh? Yeah.\n\nI want you to have it.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhy?\n\nI've just been doing some thinking about the people I know, the ones who've walked into my life and made it better than it was before... Oh.\n\nPeople like you. Oh.\n\nAnyway, I've... I've... I've never said \"thank you.\"\n\nOh, no, I'm... I'm the one who should thank you.\n\nYou... you introduced me to all your friends.\n\nMy business couldn't be better.\n\nI'm so glad.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnyway, I, uh, I want you to have this.\n\nMrs. Young...\n\nAre you all right?\n\nEverything's fine.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYou should go now.\n\nSo I look in the window, and there's blood everywhere...\n\nAll over the walls and the ceiling... Oh!\n\nNot to mention, her hardwood floors, which she just had installed last week.\n\nI don't know what she was thinking.\n\nI just wish there had been some warning, some sign that she would do such a thing.\n\nEli scruggs sat in his truck for almost an hour, devastated that he had done nothing to save me.\n\nHe then made a quiet vow to god...\n\nFrom that moment forward, he would do what he could to help people, to help them fix their lives.\n\nAnd for the rest of his life, that's exactly what he did.\n\nThat was a lovely service.\n\nEli would've liked it.\n\nHell of a turnout. Who knew he had so many friends?\n\nI'm not surprised. He was a good man.\n\nI can't help feeling there's more we could have done to honor him.\n\nWell, let's just make sure we remember him.\n\nEli would have said that's more than most people get.\n\nAnd he would have been right...\n\nAs usual.\n\nWait.\n\nI wanted to fix something for Eli for a change.\n\nAnd somewhere, in a place reserved for the very best of us, Eli scruggs smiled and said, \"thank you.\"\n",
    "[Scene: A Theater, the gang is in the audience wating for a play of Joey's to start.]\n\nRachel: (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!\n\nChandler: You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...\n\nPhoebe: The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!\n\n(The lights dim.)\n\nRoss: Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.\n\n(The lights go up on the stage, Joey, as Freud, is talking to a female patient.)\n\nJoey: Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)\n\nAll you want is a dingle,\nWhat you envy's a schwang,\nA thing through which you can tinkle,\nOr play with, or simply let hang...\n\nOpening Credits\n\n[Scene: The Theater, the play has ended and everyone is applauding.  As soon as the cast leaves, the gang all groan and sit down heavily.]\n\nRachel: God. I feel violated.\n\nMonica: Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?\n\nChandler: (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.\n\nRoss: Is it? Feels like two.\n\nChandler: No, ten o'clock.\n\nRoss: What?\n\nChandler: (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!\n\nRoss: Oh. Hel-lo!\n\nChandler: She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!\n\nMonica: Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.\n\nChandler: Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'\n\nRachel: Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!\n\nChandler: Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.\n\nRoss: He could never get a woman like that in a million years.\n\nChandler: Thank you, buddy.\n\nPhoebe: Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.\n\nMonica: You could do that!\n\nChandler: Y'think?\n\nAll: Yeah!\n\nChandler: Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...\n\nRoss: C'mon! C'mon!\n\nChandler: Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)\n\nAurora: ...Yes?\n\nChandler: Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.\n\nAurora: Yes, you said that.\n\nChandler: Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)\n\nAurora: Chandler?\n\n(Joey enters from behind a curtain.  The others all talk at once.)\n\nAll: Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!\n\nJoey: Whadja think?\n\n(Pause)\n\nAll: ...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!\n\nJoey: C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.\n\nAll: (admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.\n\nChandler: (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)\n\nRachel: What is it?\n\nJoey: The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!\n\nPhoebe: Based on this play? ...Based on this play!\n\n[Scene: Central Perk, everyone else is there as Chandler enters.]\n\nChandler: Hey, kids.\n\nAll: Hey.\n\nPhoebe: (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.\n\nChandler: Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.\n\nMonica: Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?\n\nChandler: It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...\n\n(A flashback of Aurora and Chandler on their date in Central Perk is denoted by italics.)\n\nAurora: ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.\n\nChandler: Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.\n\nChandler: We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.\n\nAurora: ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.\n\nChandler: Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?\n\nAurora: 'We' would be me and Rick.\n\nJoey: Who's Rick?\n\nChandler: Who's Rick?\n\nAurora: My husband.\n\nAll: Ooooohhh.\n\nChandler: Oh, so you're divorced?\n\nAurora: No.\n\nChandler: Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?\n\nAurora: No, I'm still married.\n\nChandler: So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?\n\nAurora: Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.\n\nChandler: Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?\n\nAurora: Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.\n\nAll: What?!\n\nChandler: So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?\n\nAurora: I suppose mainly sexual.\n\nChandler: ...Hm.\n\nMonica: Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.\n\nChandler: What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?\n\nMonica: Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?\n\nChandler: Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!\n\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?\n\nRoss: No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.\n\nMonica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?\n\nJoey: I couldn't do it.\n\nMonica: Good for you, Joey.\n\nJoey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.\n\nRoss: Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-\n\n(They all pretend to fall asleep.)\n\nRoss: Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.\n\nMonica: We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!\n\nAll: Yeah! C'mon!\n\nRoss: Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-\n\n(They all fall asleep again.)\n\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as enter except Joey enter.]\n\nRachel: Tah-daaah!\n\nChandler: Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.\n\nRachel: Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.\n\nRoss: Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.\n\nRachel: Well, whaddya think?\n\nAll: Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!\n\nMonica: ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.\n\nAll: Uh-oh...\n\nMonica: How-how did that happen?\n\nRachel: I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.\n\nMonica: Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.\n\nPhoebe: (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.\n\nChandler: Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.\n\nMonica: You guys, I am not that bad!\n\nPhoebe: Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!\n\nMonica: That is so unfair!\n\nRoss: Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!\n\nMonica: Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.\n\nRoss: Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.\n\nMonica: Why not?\n\nRoss: Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.\n\nMonica: I could do that.\n\nRachel: Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.\n\nMonica: Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.\n\nChandler: Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...\n\nMonica: STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?\n\nRoss: Monica? You're Mom.\n\n(Monica gasps.)\n\nPhoebe: Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!\n\n(Joey enters and he's on the phone.)\n\nJoey: (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!\n\nAll: Oh my God! Whoah!\n\nMonica: Well, what's the part?\n\nJoey: Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! \"I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!\"\n\nPhoebe: Seriously, what-what's the part?\n\nJoey: \"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!\"\n\nRoss: C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?\n\nJoey: ...I'm his (mumbles)\n\nRachel: ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?\n\nJoey: ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.\n\nMonica: (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.\n\nJoey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!\n\nChandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.\n\nJoey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!\n\nRoss: You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?\n\nCommercial Break\n\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Monica is getting the door.]\n\nMonica: Alright, alright, alright...\n\n(Joey enters with Monica's paper and hands it to her.)\n\nJoey: Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.\n\nMonica: For what?\n\nJoey: Whaddya think? Today's the big day!\n\nMonica: Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.\n\nJoey: Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)\n\n(Chandler enters with the phone.)\n\nChandler: Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.\n\nMonica: He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!\n\nChandler: C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!\n\nMonica: I warned you...\n\n(Rachel enters from her room.)\n\nRachel: Who is being loud?\n\nChandler: Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.\n\nMonica: Oh, you got the whole night, huh?\n\nChandler: Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)\n\nRachel: Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?\n\nChandler: No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)\n\nMonica: Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.\n\n(She opens the door and he leaves.)\n\n[Scene: A Film Set, Joey is entering for his scene.]\n\nDirector: (on phone)...Dammit, hire the girl! (He hangs up the phone.) Okay, everybody ready?\n\nJoey: Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.\n\nDirector: Lose the robe.\n\nJoey: Me?\n\nDirector: That would work.\n\nJoey: Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.\n\nDirector: Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working (The shower starts).. and... action.\n\n(Joey starts to the shower with a grim, determined look on his face.)\n\nDirector: And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?\n\nJoey: Well, I'm- I'm showering.\n\nDirector: No, that was clenching.\n\nJoey: Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.\n\nDirector: I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?\n\nJoey: I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...\n\n[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Aurora and Chandler are in bed in Chandler's room.]\n\nChandler: God, I love these fingers...\n\nAurora: Thank you.\n\nChandler: No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.\n\nAurora: (moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She starts to get up.)\n\nChandler: Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)\n\nAurora: Okay.\n\nChandler: Don't go.\n\nAurora: Okay. Oh no, I have to.\n\nChandler: (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.\n\nAurora: (getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.\n\nChandler: Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.\n\nAurora: It's not Rick.\n\nChandler: What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!\n\nAurora: No, it's-it's Andrew.\n\nChandler: I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?\n\nAurora: He's... new.\n\nChandler: Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?\n\nAurora: No, that's not exactly what I was..\n\nChandler: Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.\n\nAurora: So what do you want?\n\nChandler: You.\n\nAurora: You have me!\n\nChandler: Nono, just you.\n\nAurora: Whaddyou mean?\n\nChandler: Lose the other guys.\n\nAurora: ...Like, ...all of them?\n\nChandler: C'mon, we're great together, why not?\n\nAurora: Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.\n\nChandler: ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'\n\nAurora: So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?\n\nChandler: I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...\n\nAurora: Which one?\n\nChandler: ...The second guy.\n\nAurora: (gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.\n\n(She kisses him, he holds her, and kisses her passionately.)\n\nChandler: Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.\n\n(She leaves, Chandler sighs, and falls back on his bed.)\n\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is trying to comfort Chandler.  Joey is absent.]\n\nRoss: Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?\n\n(Joey enters.)\n\nAll: Hey!\n\nMonica: Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?\n\nJoey: Nope.\n\nRoss: No? What happened, big guy?\n\nChandler: (to Ross) \"Big guy?\"\n\nRoss: It felt like a 'big guy' moment.\n\nJoey: I got fired.\n\nAll: Oh!\n\nJoey: Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...\n\nRachel: Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.\n\nJoey: My mom will.\n\nChandler: Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.\n\nJoey: Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!\n\nMonica: Maybe this wasn't your shot.\n\nRoss: Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?\n\nJoey: Hard to tell, I was naked.\n\nPhoebe: No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part!

Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?\n\nMonica: Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.

No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)",
    "In case you're looking for a way to reach me:\n\nMy snail-mail addresses are: Zandstraat 28-1, 1011 HL Amsterdam (home) and: Postbus 9010, 6500 GL Nijmegen, or: Room 03.04, Mercator 1, Toernooiveld 212, 6525 EC Nijmegen (work).\nMy telephone numbers are 06-20422671 (mobile) and 024-3652649 (work) and the fax number of my work is 024-3652728.\nMy e-mail is freek@cs.ru.nl (if you want to make sure that your mail won't be eaten by my spam filter, mention free ultrafilters in the subject line of your message).\nFor my American friends: the name Freek is pronounced like \"Phrake\". It's a perfectly ordinary Dutch name (from Frederic), no reference to freak was ever intended. And \"Wiedijk\" is pronounced like \"Weedike\".\n\nI'm a mathematician (without a specialization, but with a fondness for algebraic and topological subjects), who tried to learn physics (and failed) and computers (love them, but only when they're not a mess.) My M.Sc. thesis was about the geometry of supergravity (that's mathematical physics) and my Ph.D. thesis was about conservativity in modular specifications (that's mathematical computer science.) After I got my Ph.D. I worked for six years as a system and network administrator at Utrecht University. I'm currently working in the project of Henk Barendregt and Herman Geuvers. I used to be a Coq programmer in the fundamental theorem of algebra project, and then I was a four-year postdoc. Currently I've become an assistant professor and at the moment I'm teaching a course about \"formal thinking\" for first year students, a course about computability for second year students, and a type theory and Coq course for master level students. I also am tutor of a small group of first year students. Finally I keep a weblog with interviews of our students (as propaganda for our study).\n\nI don't have too many publications of my own (one of them is a comparison between provers), but I wrote several notes and I sometimes give talks. I authored one computer program: an Automath checker. It's portable (vanilla C), simple (3000 lines of code) and fast (on my current computer the test file which is Jutting's translation of a complete mathematical book gets checked in 0.6 seconds.) A simpler thing I authored is a small script called raft for doing proof developments with Otter. Something else I did: I compiled a list of computer math systems to investigate the state of the art in digital mathematics, which I have put on the web and will try to keep complete and up to date. And I wrote a small page about Mizar, which is a system for proof checking that deserves to be known much better than it is. I also wrote a page with a list of possible proof checking projects. And then I have a page which investigated which of a list of 100 theorems have been formalized in which systems. Finally, I organised a session with proof assistant demos at ICMS 2006.\n\nI also scanned Brouwer's notebooks (from his PhD period) together with John Kuiper.\n\nI'm living (with elfish friend and big son \u2013 a great source of passwords \u2013 and small son and daughter and far too many mice) in three very small and unfinished but quite tranquil apartments, right next to the Zuiderkerk in Amsterdam. Sometimes I'm not there. Then I'm somewhere else.\n\nI've lots of ways to pass time: children's books and strips, swimming and going to the sauna, dreams and their meanings, various kinds of divination (no, I'm not a believer :-)), looking into the night sky, roaming through the Second Colour Maze (which to me looks a bit like the 4004), reading the occasional science fiction, playing the occasional computer game, collecting dice (only two to go!), folk dancing (fondly remembering Praznik), modern dancing and recently some Argentinean tango, gliding (once, for a week, but I'd like to do it again one day), typography and fonts, scanning books (like Teirlinck's Flora Magica), studying color (there is a ColorChecker on my desk), and I'm thinking of learning wall climbing (those climbing walls are so very beautiful) or maybe aikido. However, I spend most of my actual time behind the computer, in the train (there and back again takes four hours) and in bed.",
    "Meh~\n\nJust meh~ This book is basically two books sold as one. Part 1 on its own would have gotten 3 stars from me. It was okay, kind of uninspiring YA, but it steered away from all the melodrama I was expecting. That counts for something.\n\nI'm a strong believer in judging YA-themed stories by the adult characters. Our cast in Something Like Summer includes many of the usual cliches: Rich Neglectful Parents, Abusive Controlling Tyrants, People So Liberal in Child Rearing It Borders on Criminal (otherwise known as the 'cool parents' who seem okay with treating their kids like inconvenient social equals after a pretentious lecture from a self-righteous teenager) ... all we're missing is the Hip Teacher dishing out sagely life advice.\n\nIn fairness, there are some attempts to move beyond these stereotypes and make the archetypes richer and more complex ... but not much. Ultimately this is a m/m love story.\n\nAnd about that love story. It grew on me. Tim is kind of an ass, but you see enough of his good side to tolerate it. Ben, is kind of pathetic ... but pathetic in the way teenagers in love typically are.\n\nSo again, not over the moon, but there was enough sweetness to help me enjoy the trials and tribulations of Tim/Ben\n\nThen Part 2 came.\n\nPart 2 was a train wreck, an absolute train wreck in which all the likable characters from the first part might as well have been eaten by zombies. The characters we were supposed to rally around were bland and undeveloped. There was nary a rational thought in sight.\n\nTake for example Ben's best friend Allison. Part 2 starts with a three year jump. Everyone has gone away to college, Ben has moved across the country. He returns home (view spoiler) and a distraught Allison begs him to transfer to her college for moral support. Apparently in three years, vivacious outgoing Allison has made no friends??? None at all? She needs to force her former bestie to uproot his entire life midsemester because in three years she hasn't grown close to anyone else?\n\nThis seems inconsistant with the Allison we met in the beginning. A character who reached beyond the girl-wingman/cheap-therapist/author-avatar cliche we see so often in these books. She had her own life, her own issues, her own love interests in Part 1. In Part 2 her whole purpose is to direct the course of Ben's love life. Make sure he stays on the path to true luv.\n\nBullshit.\n\nTim meanwhile has gone from being a sweet, good natured guy whose sexual confusion causes him to act like an asshole from time to time ... to a desperate manipulative cock slut. *sigh* I'm so tired of controlling and abusive behavior being sold to people as a man showing the \"vulnerability\" and the intensity of his love. Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit.\n\nI don't even understand the point of Part 2. It seems to be devoted to giving Ben another love interest, but the author never really invests anything in Jace as a character. What color is his hair? His eyes? What (besides fortune cookies) are his interests? If it was there I certainly can't remember it. Jace is completely one-dimensional, bland in every conceivable way: he's always good, always faithful, always loves unconditional. We spend a lot of time with Ben/Jace but it ends up feeling like a romance en summary. There's no real emotion in their courtship because the author never wants you to want to see them together.",

    "   MY DEAR DAX -  If I were not your debtor already\nI should owe you a letter now to thank you for\nyour kind invitation to my brother.  On arrival at\nLewes I was welcomed by my two cousins, young girls,\nfull of fun and talk, with whom I talked fun until\neleven.  I fancy they got a little tired at last of the\noutrageous rubbish I poured out, though they could\nnot help laughing on; but I had resolved not to end\ntill I felt tired enough to be sure of falling asleep\nthe moment I jumped into bed.  In the service next\nmorning I omitted the Psalms bodily, and preached\nextempore - both of which proceedings electrified my\ncousins' congregation.  The former, however, introduced\nme to a Mr. Lower, the genius and antiquarian\nof the place, who has a penchant for liturgical reform,\nand fancied my omission to have been intentional. \nThough disappointed on this point by my candid\nconfession of forgetfulness, he conveyed me the next\nmorning over the old castle, and from the top of the\nkeep pointed out the battlefield on the downs.  A\ngleam of sunlight lit up the edge of the Wealden,\nand brought back the thought of you.  Lower had\nknown Mantell, who resided at Lewes, and had a little\nsmattering of geology himself.  Our conversation\nturned on the \"Celt\" question, and as he was sceptical.\n\nI promised him your notes on the discovery in Wookey,\na promise which I hope you will perform for your\nsponsor's credit.  A kind note from Stanley offering\nme a curacy, welcomed me home.  I was glad to find\nMrs. Ward returned;  her womanly tact discovered that\nall was not well, and without inquiry she petted me into\ngood spirits.  I spent the bulk of yesterday pounding\nat Dunstan in the British Museum.  I shall begin\nmy Hist. Somerset there to-day.  I have routed up\nCuthbert, and am throwing him into a paper for some\nmagazine.  My Oxford papers I intend now completing,\nthe work will amuse me, and will pay its expenses. \nWhat a grand friend Work is! \n   By-the-bye can you tell me of a good map of\nSomerset, of less size than our unwieldy Ordnance\nGentleman, yet minute enough for my purposes?  The\ncountry below Lewes, once a seamarsh, now flat\nmeadow-land intersected with dykes, brought back\nGlastonbury, and to complete the resemblance there\nare the same rounded hillocks with endings in \"eye\"\nwhich point to a time when they stood like Godneye,\nisolated spots amid the waters.  I saw Rolleston and\nDaubeny nominated as your examiners for the Scholarship. \nI am glad you will thus be brought across the\nlatter.  His wide acquaintance with Scientific \"Swells\"\nwould enable him to be of most essential service to\nyou, if he chose.  Although there is little doubt of the\nmatter, it will be a \"white day\" for me when I see\nyou gazetted as Scholar.  It will be the \"beginning of\nthe end.\"  I can fancy no happier lot than a quiet\nlittle parsonage, with income to let me scribble as I\nplease, and offer a breath of rural air to you or Dobbs\nwhen you could spare a moment from the rush of\nscience or politics.  If you will promise this I will\nremain Bachelor to the end of my days. \n   You will not, I am sure, forget how pleasant an\narrival the postman's is now.  Good-bye, my dear\nDawkins.  - Believe me ever, your sincere friend,\nJ. R. GREEN. ",
    " When we were at Ravenscroft, Mrs. Green of Whitebrook,\nspoke to us several times about Spiritualism, & promised us\nan introduction to her sister-in-law, Mrs. Acworth, who is a\nremarkable medium.  Accordingly we went to see her by\nappointment today at Haywards Heath, where she & her                                \nhusband live.  Dr. Acworth met us at the station.  On\narriving at the house, \"Elfinsward,\" we found Mrs.\nAcworth a little lady of unprepossessing appearance, dark,\nlarge eyes which occasionally dilate & become round; black\nhair all curly over her head & projecting over her forehead,\nsmall delicate hands.  Dr. Acworth told us how he had been\nconverted.  A medium had once told him that a spirit\nnamed \"Ellen\" was present, & that she had had an untold\nattachment to him in life.  Dr. Acworth knew no Ellen &\nthe spirit could give no further name.  He puzzled long\nover this, till he met his present wife, who identified the\nspirit by mentioning things which could have only been\nknown to him & the spirit.  Dr. Acworth then recognized\nthe lady, but her name had not been Ellen.  This was the\nname of a sister whom she had wronged, which she was\nobliged to bear for a time as an atonement.  Mrs. Acworth\nhad never known the spirit, nor did she then know Dr.\nAcworth.  Mrs. Acworth told us that once when putting up\nmedicines for her husband's patients a number of little\npearls fell around her.  She prayed that two might fall stuck\ntogether, & this occurred.  She showed us the pearls; very\nsmall, & two pairs stuck together.  There were also curious\nspirit-drawings which she produced.  After long conversation,\nwe sat down round a small wooden table, no cloth; Dr.\nAcworth not touching it.  Soon his arm shook convulsively,\n& he explained that a spirit wanted to speak through him. \nHaving placed both hands on the table he repeated the\nalphabet, & at certain letters his hands were violently\nrapped on the table, the movement coming from the elbow. \nThe first letter always gave him the whole word; e.g., if\n\"Y\" were rapped, he at once said \"You\" or \"Your\" &\nwent on.  The messages were uninteresting, \"you very\nworthless unredeemed spirit\" &c.  At 5 we dined, &\nafter dinner the s\u201aance became more interesting.  Even\nbefore dinner Mrs. Acworth had seen a male spirit standing\nby Kate, but foggy:  after dinner the raps, almost inaudible\nbefore, became distinct, though never loud.  Dr. Acworth\nrapped out \"Your friends will return thoroughly convinced\"\n\n(this I think came before dinner too), & then after some time\nI was told a spirit belonging to me was there.  Would it give\nits name?  Three raps; the hands of both mediums being\nvisible, full light, & no cloth.  I went through the alphabet,\nKate writing down.  If anything I expected \"J\" to come\nfirst, to my surprise it was \"T.\"  Then raps came at\nE, N, N, E, J, S, R, E, B, M.  This seemed nonsense;  Kate\nhad twice said it was nothing, & we need hardly go on; \nI had said it was certainly not a name I knew.  But at this\npoint I took up the paper, & to my amazement saw the very\nname I had expected spelt backwards, & the Christian name\nspelt wrongly.  So I went on, & A. H. C. came next [\\[Jennet\nChambers]\\].  We were both astonished.  I asked a few simple\nquestions, & the replies were right.  One was, how many\nyears ago did I first know you?  (I did not remember)  I\ncounted to 11;  raps came;  then I thought & said to myself,\nit is 12, not 11, I went on to 12;  louder raps;  & I recollected\nnow that it was between 11 & 12 years ago.  I asked if she was\nhappy, if her father had been a spiritualist, &c., & the\naffirmative replies came by raps.  When asked to give my\nwife's name it rapped YLN (end of Stanly) & TAK,\nomitting the E.  We did not pursue the Stanley to the end. \nAfter a few other question [^SIC EDN^], Mrs. A said the spirit was\nexhausted.  Some things she did not answer, as in what\nmonth I last met her. \n   Before (or after) this; (the order has escaped me) Kate\nhad felt a peculiar sensation in her arm, a tingling from the\nelbow.  Mrs. Acworth said she would be a writing medium. \nBy a spirit's direction through Dr. Acworth a cedar pencil was\nbrought, my silver pencil having been tried in vain.  Mrs.\nAcworth said they could not write through metal.  With\nthe cedar pencil her hand moved without will, but no clear\nmarks were made.  All this time as well as before dinner\nMrs. Acworth had declared that she saw the male spirit\nstanding by her & that he wished to communicate (Mrs.\nAcworth had not seen Janet).  However nothing came. \n   At another period Dr. A rapped out as the name of a\nspirit \"The late Lord William Russell.\"  Mrs. Acworth thought of the great Lord Russell.  We asked if it was the\nfather of the Duke of Bedford;  yes.  At this period Mrs. A\nread as if from a scroll in the air.  \"Tell him that he will\nbecome the Duke of Bedford let him regard my words.\" \nEvidently a false prophecy, from whomsoever emanating. \nCould it have been suggested to Mrs. Acworth's mind by\nthe question just preceding?  But I am sure she honestly\nread the words; & the effect was curious.  About the figure\nof Kate's male friend, who asserted he was a lover dead not\nlong ago, she had seen words, but one was not distinct, & as\nit made a serious blank I forget the first part.  The end was - \n\"blessing to home & country,\" blessing I believe being\nwritten large.  We tried to get his name, but only W. was\ngiven.  After that no more raps came.  Twice over the\nspirits told Dr. Acworth \"Give your wife some more wine,\"\nbut the second time she refused to comply.  One of the evil\nspirits he is troubled by gave his name as \"James the second\nking of England\" & said he was very worthless.  We laughed,\n& said he was indeed worthless.  Upon which Dr. Acworth\nvery gravely remarked that he did not think we ought to say\nthis of a spirit who announced himself as worthless.  These\nbad spirits intercede with him for his prayers on their\nbehalf, yet do him mischief.  Last night he had found his\nbedclothes wet through. \n   In one case a cancer which appeared incurable (on the\nneck) was suddenly cured, & Mrs. Acworth attributes this\nto the effect of a prayer of hers that a certain medicine might\nbe blessed.  We both came home perplexed, but not convinced. \n   I must not omit to note a prophecy: that Germany will\nbe Federal, & not Imperial -  Another - that the peace\nbetween France & Germany is but an armed truce - is too\ncommon an opinion among men to be worth remarking as\na prediction of the spirits.

    "             Well, I stand corrected, again.  Yesterday I blogged that Coquitlam was an oasis of Whiteness in the sea of Asians that is Vancouver, but oh how I was wrong.  We went to the, aptly named, Coquitlam Mall today and put Spencer in the play area with a few other kids.  I heard a lady speaking Korean to her boy, then a flock (well, three) ajumas (older Korean ladies) came and sat near us.  Later, when we went to the pool, we saw that the neighbors right next to us and across the street are Koreans too.  Then on the way back I learned that another two sets of neighbors are Korean as well.  They're everywhere!  It's actually pretty cool.  One thing about Koreans is they have a pretty good sense of community.  Get a group of white people (who aren't farmers) together and we seem to be pretty stand-offish...or at least it takes a while to warm up.  Koreans, as you may know,  urlLink refer to each other as sister or brother  as soon as 3 minutes of meeting one another (as I have seen).  This is, I think, quite extraordinary.  From first meetings with my son my wife called the girls in the area 'nuna' or 'older sister, as said by a  younger brother' (they have a special word for every family member).  Also, since Koreans don't normally take to English all that well (or quickly) they really, really appreciate speaking with someone from home.  Thus, the community here is quite tight.  So I've still got jetlag...although it's pretty nice not to have to work through it.  The boys tend to keep me moving all day, though.  Usually I sleep at 3AM or 4AM then get up at 11AM, but it's not a good  urlLink REM  sleep.  My best sleep seems to be 1-2 hour naps at 3PM or 7PM.  When I wake up from those it's really like getting up in the morning; and getting up in the morning is like waking up at midnight.  My father-in-law thinks I should just adjust 100% in like 2 days, but I'm not sure if I'm built that way.  If I need to I can do it, but it's like I'm on vacation here.  Besides, I do my work at night anyways, when the kids are asleep (and Seoul is awake).  I guess that's it for now.  Nothing more profound than this from the day, which is a little sad.  I love it here: so clean, peaceful and easy to live; but I kinda miss Seoul too: so dirty, loud and easy to get run down by  urlLink deliveryboys on motorcycles .         ",
    "             It's been a busy last couple of weeks, but I'm on my way back to Seoul today.   Didn't get near what I wanted to get done on this trip--had planned on heading downtown to see a few buds but couldn't get the time to get away at all.  A few friends made the trek up to our place, though, which was cool.  It's nice to see friends you've known for 10-20 years after being away for a while.  One guy that came up here was a friend of a sister of a friend who is marrying (as soon as he gets the familial blessing) a Korean, so my wife and I gave him the 411 on Koreans and ways to do things.  (More on that when I get back to Seoul, and have more time.)  Got to go now.         ",
    "                  Election time has rolled around again. And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their 'tact'. Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state    'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move.  Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more:  'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism.  Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string.  Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight.  'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal!  I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed.                     ",

    "       seriously. don't get me started.  seriously.   well look, it's like this. i find haircuts traumatic; possibly moreso than most things in my life. if that sounds odd, consider this. i have never - ever - in my life received a haircut that i was happy with. content, even. not one. ever. i am twenty five; having been alive for a quarter of a century, how many haircuts do you suppose i have had? how many have you had? i haven't liked a single one of them. not one.   let me elaborate. haircuts are traumatic before you get anywhere near the hairdressers; it begins with people starting to tell you to get your hair cut, or more likely just making snide comments at the expansiveness of your mane. so then you decide to get it cut, and things get serious. what cut do you want? how do you want to appear to the rest of the world? i hate the idea of stepping out of the shop and declaring 'yes, i paid money to look this specific way'. and why do i hate that idea? i pay money to dress the way i do, to go the places i do, so what's the difference? ah, good question, and the answer is one of life's little secrets: hairdressers never do what you ask them to. they only ever do *what they were going to anyway*. it makes no matter what you say to them, you will only ever leave the shop when *they* are happy that you look like they want you to. we are helpless; once our hair is cut from our heads gravity takes over, and we never get it back. we are at the mercy of the hairdresser; someone, you'll note, who invariably has hair that you personally wouldn't be seen dead with. strange, that, eh? yes its true, whatever you ask for you're leaving looking 'trendy'.  or even worse, as happened to me last time: having an interview the next day i asked to look 'sensible'. i actually came out looking 'like i was in the marines'. tossers. (hairdressers, not the marines...)   and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr.   is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again.   i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much.   when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect.  i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh.   even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through.  i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it.   i hate the hairdressers. i really do.

    "              Picnic  Wow, today's CNY picnic for church was a load off my mind. Praise God for the good weather, and everything went smoothly, and everyone had a good time. All the running around, blood, sweat and tears was worth it.  We had games - a group skits, CNY karaoke competition, and of course, a Lion Dance! Oh man, spent the whole night before sticking and layering the crepe paper onto cardboard boxes. Darn...what a waste.  If I had server space, I'd upload some photos so u guys can check out...but unfortunately...ah wells. But trust me, we had a lot of fun, and lots to eat, and everyone pretty much seemed to enjoy themselves, and we also had sparklers too! And lanterns...yes, even though lanterns are more for Mooncake/Lantern festival, but hey, it's still Chinese-y eh?  A funny story I heard today btw. A group of the people from church were in Chinatown, enjoying the festivities, when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about Asian businesses in Chinatown. She rejected it though, saying 'I'm not Asian!' under her breath. Thing is, she's Chinese! But she doesn't consider herself one I suppose. A couple of Aussies there heard it too, then smiled.  I wonder, why do 2nd-generation Asians sometimes deny their heritage? It's a whole issue I've been reading about for class, the diasporic community in a new homeland, and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds. About 95% of the people in my church are Asians, a good number being Aussie-born Asians. I wonder how they really see themselves; most don't speak Mandarin, some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in S'pore or M'sia, and a lot don't know a large part of their cultural heritage. Few of the Asian-Aussies turned up for the CNY picnic today - most were the Intn'l students, and the adults.  I guess now I'm beginning to appreciate and value the education I had growing up, being forced to learn Mandarin for 11 years ('O' and 'AO'-level Chinese). Some of it really sticks to your brain yah? I guess if I end up settling down in a country where my Mother Tongue isn't widely spoken, or part of the curriculum, I'd also send my kids to Chinese School, just to learn a bit of their heritage, language and culture, something extremely important (and marketable!) in this global age.   They can thank me for it later.             ",
    "       I have seasoned chicken in the oven right now.  The smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after I put it in the 350\u00c2\u00ba box.  The smell is of earthy paprika, pungent garlic, and sweet basil.  It smells like home, like a weekday dinnertime when a family's house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering.   My father gave me this container which describes its contents as 'The World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Best Chicken Rub.'  He bought it at Food Lion, a place I never go because Ukrop's has spoiled me and I am OK with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking, or lack there of.  I don't even know where a Food Lion is around here.  I'm sure I've passed one on my travels trough town, but I couldn't tell you where.  The seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the Food Lion bag with the receipt still inside.  Two containers where purchased, one for me and for my brothers family.  I think I was the afterthought, but my dear sweet dad didn't want to leave me out.     The seasoning is described as a 'rub' and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken.  In my kitchen, the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice.  A poor single girl's kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery, i.e. brushes or fresh citrus.  I actually do own a cooking brush, however, I believe I bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that I would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter.  I have made none so far.    The brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on Easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided I would cook a ham for the family on Saturday night.  I didn't know until I was cooking it that this would be my job.  I've never cooked a ham before.  Luckily, store-bought spiral sliced hams are pre-cooked, you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them.  The glazing scared me and when I asked my mom how to do this she simply said 'brown sugar and mustard.'  'OK,' I thought 'but how the hell much of either one?'  I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask her again, she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of 'Have you learned nothing from me?' in her voice.  I looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge.  I remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so I set the stove to high flame, put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot, squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred.  The resulting taste test was good; it tasted familiar, like sweet Easter ham.    Two hours into the ham warm-up I pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture.  The glaze was perfect, sweet and tart and just right for a first time try.  My parents let me keep the leftovers because I'm poor and because they live 3 hours away.  I said thanks, that I'd eat on it all week.  I didn't touch it after they left, despite my glaze of glory.  The first few months I lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me (college dorms and sorority respectively) I bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week.  I researched and concocted difficult recipes from Martha Stewart and Junior League cookbooks.  I even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once.  (I've since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your 'whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage.')  Now, I've settled into the typical single girl's fridge.  I have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries, but I have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon.   In college, my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights I just didn't want to leave the apartment to go eat with my 'sisters.'  One roommate and I would try to make what we thought were balanced meals.  We would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans, boil a bag of rice, and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins.  We thought our moms would be proud.  We also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low.  During the day today I had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice.  I never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes, no friends to share the stomach with.  A single girl just doesn't have the time or the energy really for all the fuss, and especially all those dishes.  There will probably be no leftovers either (what with the 1 piece of chicken I fixed), my fridge will go another day (or 10) with not much more than fancy mustard and light Italian dressing.  But, right now my dinner's calling me.         ",
    "       This is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year,  'I am about to finish up two year of MBA education at the Wharton School and will start work in September at McKinsey & Co in their Brussels office. Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days...'  Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years.  The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days.  Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like 'I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years.'  And my podunk fellow classmates would think 'Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers.  I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight.'  OK, well, anyway, I've got to run.  My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes.  Wahoowah!          ",
    "       When I checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized, cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it, I thought 'Oh hell, here's another one.'  I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May.  As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, 'And so the season begins.'  Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life.  I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small.  Since college, they just keep on coming.  Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s.  Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home.  I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway.  This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me  (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people).  That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator).  I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway.  This is all about me.  I mean, it's always about me anyway, right?    This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me.  These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor.  When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone.  Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent.  One friend said, 'Well, at least you're getting closer.'  I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway.  So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need.  I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come.  But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no.  I've already rescued myself.  I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet.  No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him.  I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have.  I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones.          ",
    "       I was playing with my 3 year-old niece today when she said 'I'm the king of the castle.'  Then pointed to me and said, 'You're the dirty rascal.'  And I was immediately placed inside the melody of CRASH.  I was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a Dave Matthews song.   Then later, in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill I heard a bright, highpicthed song lingering in the air.  I knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck.  Whew!  How long has it been since I've seen on one of those.  Oh, the days of yore.  *sigh*         ",

Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.\n\nLeonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.\n\nSheldon: In what space, sir, in what space? She\u2019s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he\u2019d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.\n\nLeonard: Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman\u2019s flight is a feat of strength.\n\nSheldon: Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman\u2019s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth\u2019s yellow Sun.\n\nHoward: Yeah, and you don\u2019t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.\n\nSheldon: Uh, a combination of the moon\u2019s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.\n\nPenny: I\u2019m just going to go wash up.\n\nLeonard: I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.\n\nSheldon: Challenge accepted.

The package slides back down to the bottom.)\n\nSheldon: Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.\n\nTime shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway, not their own.\n\nSheldon: You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?\n\nLeonard: Men do things for women without expecting sex.\n\nSheldon: Yeah, those are men who just had sex.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there\u2019s no way it could lower the odds.\n\nQuick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the top of the staircase.\n\nLeonard: Almost there, almost there, almost there.

The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I\u2019m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table\u2019s having a tiny garage sale.\n\nLeonard: Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?\n\nSheldon: No.\n\nLeonard: Well they don\u2019t.

Sound of door opening and closing somewhere else is heard. Leonard wakes, puts on his glasses and looks at the clock. It is 2:16.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon?\n\nScene: The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon? Hello?\n\n(Notices front door is open, turns off light sabre.)\n\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon!\n\nSheldon: Sssshhhh! Penny\u2019s sleeping.\n\nLeonard: Are you insane, you can\u2019t just break into a woman\u2019s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.\n\nSheldon: I had no choice. I couldn\u2019t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was\u2026 this.\n\nLeonard: Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we\u2019re here?\n\nSheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.\n\nLeonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation, it\u2019s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.\n\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous. I have no peers.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, we have to get out of here.\n\n(Penny snores)\n\nSheldon: You might want to speak in a lower register.\n\nLeonard: What?\n\nSheldon: Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they\u2019ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.\n\nLeonard: That\u2019s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)\n\nSheldon: No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nLeonard (doing likewise): Fine. I accept your premise, now please let\u2019s go.\n\nSheldon: I am not leaving until I\u2019m done.\n\nLeonard: O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).\n\nSheldon: If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.\n\nLeonard: Oh, what the hell.\n\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s living room, morning. Sheldon enters, singing to himself.\n\nSheldon: Morning.\n\nLeonard: Morning.\n\nSheldon: I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour\u2019s apartment and clean.\n\nSheldon: Sarcasm?\n\nLeonard: You think?\n\nSheldon: Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny\u2019s quality of life.\n\nLeonard: You know what, you\u2019ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.\n\nSheldon: You don\u2019t think that crosses a line?\n\nLeonard: Yes! For God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.\n\nSheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?\n\nLeonard: No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.\n\nSheldon: Do you want some cereal. I\u2019m feeling so good today I\u2019m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.\n\nPenny (voice off): Son of a Bitch!\n\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s up.\n\nPenny (voice off): You sick, geeky bastards!\n\nLeonard: How did she know it was us?\n\nSheldon: I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.\n\nPenny (voice off): Leonard!\n\nLeonard: God, this is going to be bad.\n\nSheldon: Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.\n\nPenny (entering): You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?\n\nLeonard: Yes, but, only to clean.\n\nSheldon: Really more to organise, you\u2019re not actually dirty, per se.\n\nPenny: Give me back my key.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m very, very sorry.\n\nPenny: Do you understand how creepy this is.\n\nLeonard: Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.\n\nPenny: In my apartment, while I was sleeping.\n\nSheldon: And snoring. And that\u2019s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It\u2019s a throat doctor.\n\nPenny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?\n\nSheldon: Depending on the depth, that\u2019s either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading \u201cSarcasm\u201d) Oh!\n\nPenny: God!\n\nLeonard: Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you\u2019re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you\u2019re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.\n\nPenny: Stay away from me.\n\nLeonard: Sure, that\u2019s another way to go.\n\nSheldon: Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive.\n\nLeonard: You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What\u2019s funny?\n\nSheldon: That wasn\u2019t sarcasm?\n\nLeonard: No.\n\nSheldon: Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny\u2019s door.) I have a masters and two PhD\u2019s, I should not have to do this.\n\nPenny (opening door): What?\n\nSheldon: I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won\u2019t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could.\n\nScene: The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.\n\nPenny: Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey, listen, I don\u2019t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I\u2019m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?\n\nRaj (internally, while Penny continues to talk): Ooh, she\u2019s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?\n\nPenny: You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don\u2019t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?\n\nRaj (internally): She\u2019s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I\u2019d be better off with an Indian girl. We\u2019d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.\n\nPenny: It\u2019s obvious that they meant well, but I\u2019m just, I\u2019m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it\u2019s just freaking me out.\n\nRaj (internally sings an Indian lullaby.)\n\nPenny: I mean, just because most of the men I\u2019ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn\u2019t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?\n\nRaj (internally): She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Does.)\n\nPenny: That\u2019s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You\u2019re a doll. (She hugs him.)\n\nRaj (internally): Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.)\n\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game.\n\nHoward (jumping off game mat): Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s fine. You win.\n\nHoward: What\u2019s his problem?\n\nSheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.\n\nHoward: Been there.\n\nRaj (entering): Hello. Sorry I\u2019m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.\n\nHoward: Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?\n\nRaj: Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.\n\nLeonard: What did she say? Is she still mad at me?\n\nRaj: Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and\u2026 then she hugged me.\n\nHoward: She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.) Is that her perfume I smell?\n\nRaj: intoxicating, isn\u2019t it?\n\nScene: The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny\u2019s door. It opens.\n\nPenny: Hi.\n\nLeonard: Oh.\n\nPenny: What\u2019s going on?\n\nLeonard: Um, here\u2019s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one\u2019s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie\u2019s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research\u2026.\n\nPenny: Leonard.\n\nLeonard: Yeah.\n\nPenny (hugs him): We\u2019re okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)\n\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.\n\nLeonard: Six two inch dowels.\n\nSheldon: Check.\n\nLeonard: One package, Phillips head screws.\n\nSheldon: Check.\n\nPenny: Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.\n\nLeonard: No, please, we insist, it\u2019s the least we can do considering.\n\nSheldon: Considering what? How great this place looks?\n\nHoward (across room with Raj): Oh boy, I was afraid of this.\n\nLeonard: What?\n\nHoward: These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.\n\nPenny: Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.\n\nLeonard: It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.\n\nSheldon: We could put her stereo back there.\n\nLeonard: And control it how?\n\nSheldon: Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.\n\nHoward (after Raj whispers in his ear): Good point, how you gonna cool it?\n\nPenny: Hey guys, I got this.\n\nSheldon: Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?\n\nLeonard: Also inefficient, and might be loud.\n\nHoward: How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC\u2026\n\nPenny: Guys, this is actually really simple.\n\nHoward: Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.\n\nLeonard: Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?\n\nSheldon: And if water is involved we\u2019re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.\n\nPenny: Guys, it\u2019s hot in here, I think I\u2019ll just take off all my clothes.\n\nLeonard: Oh, I\u2019ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.\n\nSheldon: Right, then the entire thing\u2019s one big heat sink.\n\nHoward: Perfect, Leonard, why don\u2019t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.\n\nLeonard: Meet back here in an hour?\n\nHoward: Done.\n\nLeonard: Got it. (They all leave).\n\nPenny: Okay, this place does look pretty good.",
    "Howard: Watch this, it\u2019s really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.\n\nHoward\u2019s phone: Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?\n\nHoward: No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.\n\nHoward\u2019s phone: Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader.\n\nHoward: No.\n\nLeonard: Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.\n\nHoward\u2019s phone: Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj\u2019s phone rings).\n\nRaj: Oh, that\u2019s very impressive. And a little racist.\n\nSheldon: If we\u2019re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.\n\nLeonard: So? We\u2019ll start now.\n\nSheldon: Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.\n\nRaj: We can split it two, two and two.\n\nHoward: If we\u2019re having anchovies on the pizza we can\u2019t take it out of bathroom time. (There is a knock on the door.)\n\nSheldon: Oh, what fresh hell is this?\n\nLeonard (opening door): Hey Penny, come on in.\n\nPenny: Hey guys.\n\nHoward: See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you\u2019ll have good luck.\n\nPenny: No you won\u2019t. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.\n\nLeonard: Sure. What\u2019s going on.\n\nPenny: Well, there\u2019s this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she\u2019s like \u201cHey, how\u2019s California,\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cAwesome\u201d \u2018cos, you know, it\u2019s not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she\u2019s invited herself out here to stay with me.\n\nSheldon: 8:08.\n\nPenny: Anyway, she got here today, and she\u2019s just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she\u2019s slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.\n\nHoward: Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.\n\nPenny: He really needs to dial it down.\n\nLeonard: So, if you don\u2019t like this Christie, why are you letting her stay?\n\nPenny: Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she\u2019s kind of family.\n\nSheldon: You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?\n\nLeonard: Oh, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a whore.\n\nPenny: No, yeah she\u2019s definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at\u2026 where\u2019s Howard?\n\nHoward (voice off): Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you\u2019re new in town.\n\nSheldon: Oh good grief.\n\nCredit Sequence\n\nScene: Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny\u2019s apartment door.\n\nPenny: Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.    \n\nSheldon: And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it\u2019s 8:13 and we\u2019re still not playing Halo.\n\nLeonard: Okay, fine, we\u2019ll just play one on one until he gets back.\n\nSheldon: One on one? We don\u2019t play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!\n\nLeonard: Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.\n\nRaj: Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there\u2019s a billion more where he came from.\n\nPenny: Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I\u2019ll play.\n\nLeonard: Great idea.\n\nSheldon: Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.\n\nPenny: Why?\n\nSheldon: Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.\n\nPenny: Oh, what, what, what?\n\nSheldon: This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.\n\nPenny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television): Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?\n\nSheldon: Mine.\n\nPenny: Okay, I got this, lock and load boys.\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s the only way we can play teams.\n\nSheldon: Yes, but whoever\u2019s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh\u2026. (another explosion)\n\nPenny: Ha-ha, there goes your head again.\n\nSheldon: Okay, this isn\u2019t at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who\u2019s just respawned, you need to give them a chance to (explosion) now come on!\n\nTime shift\n\nSheldon: Raj, Raj, she\u2019s got me cornered, cover me.\n\nPenny: Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!\n\nLeonard: Penny, you are on fire.\n\nPenny: Yeah, so is Sheldon.\n\nSheldon: Okay, that\u2019s it, I don\u2019t know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.\n\nPenny: Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.\n\nSheldon: What?\n\nPenny: This plasma grenade. (Explosion.) Ha! Look, it\u2019s raining you!\n\nSheldon: You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.\n\nPenny: Gosh, he\u2019s kind of a sore loser, isn\u2019t he?\n\nLeonard: Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.\n\nPenny: Well, it\u2019s been fun.\n\nLeonard: You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.\n\nPenny: Or we could just have a life.\n\nLeonard: I guess for you that\u2019s an option.\n\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\n\nLeonard: Good night.\n\nPenny: As usual, nice talking to you Raj (leaves.)\n\nRaj: What do you suppose she meant by that?\n\nLeonard: She\u2019s an enigma, Raj.\n\nSheldon: And another thing, there\u2019s a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab\u2026\n\nLeonard: She\u2019s gone, Sheldon.\n\nSheldon: Well she could have said goodbye.\n\nPenny (entering again): Okay, I have a problem.\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.\n\nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong?\n\nPenny: Um, well, Howard and Christie are\u2026 kind of\u2026 hooking up in my bedroom.\n\nLeonard: Are you sure?\n\nPenny: Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they\u2019re either having sex or Howard\u2019s caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?\n\nLeonard: No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.\n\nPenny: Uh, the couch is good.\n\nSheldon: Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.\n\nLeonard: Let me guess, you have a problem with this.\n\nSheldon: Where do I begin?\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s up to you, crazy person\u2019s choice.\n\nSheldon: Well first, we don\u2019t have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I\u2019d ask you to leave.\n\nLeonard: Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else?\n\nSheldon: Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.\n\nLeonard: So?\n\nSheldon: So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?\n\nSheldon: No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.\n\nLeonard: Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.\n\nPenny: Hu.. what?\n\nSheldon: He\u2019s engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It\u2019s the logical fallacy of extending someone\u2019s argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019ll get you a blanket and a pillow.\n\nSheldon: Okay, well since I\u2019m obviously being ignored here, let\u2019s go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly.\n\nPenny: How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?\n\nSheldon: I suggest no liquids after 11pm.\n\nLeonard: Here you go.\n\nPenny: Thanks Leonard. (Arranges pillows on left of couch.)\n\nSheldon: Hmmph, wrong.\n\nPenny: I\u2019m listening.\n\nSheldon: Your head goes on the other end.\n\nPenny: Why?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.\n\nPenny: I\u2019ll risk it.\n\nSheldon: Hm!\n\nPenny: Anything else I should know.\n\nSheldon: Yes. If you use my toothbrush I\u2019ll jump out that window. Please don\u2019t come to my funeral. Have a good night.\n\nLeonard: Sorry about that.\n\nPenny: That\u2019s okay.\n\nLeonard: FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.\n\nPenny: Got it.\n\nLeonard: Well, sleep tight.\n\nPenny: Thanks.\n\nLeonard: Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally\u2026 sleep tight.\n\n(Penny turns off light and lies down on couch. Across the room, Raj is still in the kitchen, eating a sandwich. Realising everyone has forgotten about him, he quietly lets himself out. Penny hears the door close, looks worried, then moves her head to the other end of the couch.)\n\nScene: The following morning. Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast. He crosses to the couch, sees Penny sleeping there, looks lost. He is about to sit down on Penny when Leonard enters.\n\nLeonard: What are you doing?\n\nSheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who.\n\nLeonard: Penny\u2019s still sleeping.\n\nSheldon: Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal\u2026.\n\nLeonard: I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don\u2019t you just have breakfast in bed?\n\nSheldon: Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nPenny: Uh, what time is it?\n\nLeonard: Almost 6:30.\n\nPenny: I slept all day?\n\nLeonard: Oh, no, it\u2019s 6:30 in the morning.\n\nPenny: What the hell is your problem?\n\nSheldon: Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.\n\nHoward (entering): Ola, nerd-migos.\n\nPenny: Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?\n\nHoward: Oh, yeah, sorry, I\u2019ll have it cleaned.\n\nPenny: That\u2019s okay, keep it. Where\u2019s Christie.\n\nHoward: In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won\u2019t.\n\nPenny: Y-you used my loofah?\n\nHoward: More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!\n\nPenny: You can keep that too.\n\nHoward: Ah, well then we\u2019ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.\n\nChristie (voice off): Howard?\n\nHoward: In here my lady.\n\nChristie (entering): Mmmm, there\u2019s my little engine that could.\n\nHoward: chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka (they kiss).\n\nSheldon: Well there\u2019s one beloved children\u2019s book I\u2019ll never read again.\n\nChristie: Hi, Christie.\n\nLeonard: Leonard.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m Sheldon.\n\nChristie: Right, you\u2019re Howard\u2019s entourage.\n\nPenny: Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?\n\nChristie: Oh, well, Howard said he\u2019d take me shopping in Beverley Hills.\n\nPenny: Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don\u2019t love having you, but it\u2019s\u2026 a little crowded.\n\nLeonard: Penny, you\u2019re always welcome to stay with us.\n\nSheldon: Oh, terrific, now we\u2019re running a cute little B&B.\n\nHoward: Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn\u2019t Christie stay with me.\n\nLeonard: For one thing you live with your mother.\n\nHoward: I do not, my mother lives with me.\n\nSheldon: Well then, it\u2019s all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I\u2019ll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it\u2019s more like Doctor Why Bother.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon you just can\u2019t dictate\u2026\n\nSheldon: No more talking, everybody go.\n\nHoward: So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz?\n\nChristie: What is that, like a Mexican deli?\n\nHoward: I\u2019m sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.\n\nChristie: Oh, that\u2019s so cool. My first Jew!\n\nSheldon: I imagine there aren\u2019t many kosher corn-huskers.\n\nChristie: But you\u2019re still taking me shopping, right?\n\nHoward: Anything you want.\n\nChristie: Okay, I\u2019ll go pack my stuff.\n\nHoward: When they perfect human cloning I\u2019m going to order twelve of those.\n\nLeonard: Howard, can\u2019t you see she\u2019s using you?\n\nHoward: Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!\n\nPenny: Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she\u2019ll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.\n\nHoward: Really?\n\nPenny: Yeah.\n\nHoward: Yay! If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash.\n\nScene: A Chinese restaurant.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\n\nLeonard: We can\u2019t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?\n\nSheldon: Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So\u2019s chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?\n\nLeonard: I see a problem.\n\nSheldon: Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people.\n\nLeonard: So, we\u2019ll just order three entrees.\n\nSheldon: Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling.\n\nRaj: We could cut it into thirds.\n\nSheldon: Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich.\n\nWaiter: Hi fellas. Oh, where\u2019s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?\n\nSheldon: He\u2019s putting his needs ahead of the collective good. (Pointing at waiter) Where he comes from, that\u2019s punishable by death.\n\nWaiter: I come from Sacramento.\n\nLeonard: Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.\n\nWaiter: No substitutions.\n\nLeonard: This isn\u2019t a substitution, it\u2019s a reduction.\n\nWaiter: Okay, no reductions.\n\nLeonard: Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that\u2019s twelve, we\u2019ll each have four.\n\nRaj: That works.\n\nSheldon: No, if we fill up on dumplings we\u2019ll need to eliminate another entree.\n\nWaiter: No eliminations.\n\nLeonard: If we have extra, we\u2019ll just take the leftovers home.\n\nSheldon: And divide it how, I\u2019m telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz.\n\nLeonard: Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.\n\nSheldon: Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.\n\nLeonard: We don\u2019t order egg rolls.\n\nSheldon: Exactly, but we\u2019d have to if she was here.\n\nRaj: Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there\u2019s an Indian starving right here.\n\nLeonard: Here\u2019s an idea, why don\u2019t we just go out for Indian food.\n\nSheldon: No.\n\nRaj: Uurgh.\n\nWaiter: You are nice boys. Tell you what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to bring you the four dumplings. When I\u2019m walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019ll know.\n\nWaiter: (wanders away cursing in Mandarin.)\n\nRaj: How about soup?\n\nLeonard: Yeah, we can always divide soup.\n\nSheldon: What about the won-tons?\n\nScene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks.\n\nPenny (answering): Oh, hey guys, what\u2019s up?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s Halo night.\n\nPenny: Yeah. Okay. So?\n\nLeonard: Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie,\n\nPenny: She\u2019s not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty.\n\nLeonard: Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?\n\nSheldon: Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you what an honour this is.\n\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s so sweet. But I\u2019m going out dancing with a girlfriend.\n\nSheldon: You can\u2019t go out, it\u2019s Halo night.\n\nPenny: Well, for Penny it\u2019s dancing night.\n\nSheldon: You go dancing every Wednesday.\n\nPenny: No.\n\nSheldon:  Then it\u2019s not dancing night.\n\nPenny: Look, why don\u2019t I play with you guys tomorrow?\n\nSheldon: Tonight is Halo night, it\u2019s like talking to a wall.\n\nPenny: Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.\n\nSheldon: Yes, but you didn\u2019t portray her as completely irrational.\n\nPenny: Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.\n\nLeonard: Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.\n\nSheldon: Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can\u2019t, there are three of us and two of them.\n\nLeonard: So?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child\u2019s play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.\n\nLeonard: Aaah, for God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.\n\nSheldon: Your anger\u2019s not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.\n\nLeonard: No, I\u2019m pretty sure my anger\u2019s with you.\n\nRaj: What\u2019s happening to us? We\u2019re falling apart.\n\nLeonard: Who are you calling?\n\nSheldon: The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.\n\nHoward (voice):  Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.\n\nChristie (voice): And this is Christie Van Der Bell.\n\nHoward (voice): We can\u2019t get to the phone right now because we\u2019re having sex.\n\nChristie (voice): You\u2019re not going to put that on your message are you?\n\nHoward (voice): No, I\u2019m just kidding, I\u2019ll re-record it. (beep)\n\nScene: Outside Howard\u2019s house.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, think this through, you\u2019re going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.\n\nSheldon: No, I\u2019m going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.\n\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact.\n\nSheldon: My point.\n\nChristie (voice from within): I\u2019m just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Why, so you and Howard can hump on it?\n\nHoward (voice): Ladies, ladies, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a middle ground.\n\nChristie and Howard\u2019s Mother together: Shut up Howard.\n\nHoward (voice): You girl\u2019s talk, I\u2019m going to take my scooter out for a little spin.\n\nChristie (voice as Howard emerges through door): Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house.\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): Why don\u2019t you stop butting in where you don\u2019t belong.\n\nHoward: What are you guys doing here?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s Halo night.\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): He\u2019s not a man, he\u2019s a putz, and don\u2019t you take that tone with me, you gold digger.\n\nChristie (voice): What did you call me?\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): You heard me, and I\u2019ll tell you something else, you\u2019re barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you\u2019re around, Howard is out of the will.\n\nChristie: (voice): You know what, I got better offers, I\u2019m out of here.\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (voice): That\u2019s right, go back to Babylon, you whore.\n\nHoward: So, Halo night, huh?\n\nRaj: I thought she was the whore of Omaha?\n\nSheldon: Shhh!\n\nScene: The apartment, Halo night.\n\nHoward: Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he\u2019s charging his plasma rifle.\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t shoot now, I\u2019m cloaking.\n\nLeonard: Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.\n\nRaj: I can\u2019t see him.\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s why the call it cloaking, dead man.\n\nLeonard: Well then start throwing grenades.\n\nRaj: I\u2019m all out.\n\nPenny (entering with three other sexy women): Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.\n\nLeonard: That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.\n\nSheldon: We said no tanks.\n\nRaj: There are no rules in hell!\n\nHoward: Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!\n\nPenny: Told yah! (They leave).\n\nLeonard: There\u2019s a sniper, use your rocket launcher.\n\nRaj: All I\u2019ve got is a needler, and I\u2019m all out of ammo.\n\nSheldon: And now you\u2019re out of life. Why did you hit pause?\n\nLeonard: I thought I heard something.\n\nRaj: What?\n\nLeonard: No, never mind, alright, go.",
    "Leonard: So you see, what you\u2019re eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn\u2019t have enough live acidophilus cultures. It\u2019s really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.\n\nPenny: Oh, that\u2019s very interesting.\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s also not pink and has no berries.\n\nPenny: Yeah, but it doesn\u2019t really answer my question.\n\nLeonard: What was your question again?\n\nPenny: Do you want some.\n\nLeonard: Oh, right, no, I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\n\nPenny: Right.\n\nLeonard: So, gas.\n\nPenny: Got it.\n\nLeonard: Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)\n\nPenny: What are you doing?\n\nLeonard: There was a draft.\n\nPenny: I didn\u2019t feel a draft.\n\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we just go into your\u2026.\n\nPenny: Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.\n\nLeonard: No, no, I didn\u2019t mean to go into your apartment to\u2026 go fast.\n\nPenny: No, I know, I\u2026 I know what you meant, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s only our first date.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don\u2019t we just figure out where we\u2019re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.\n\nPenny: Or we could just wing it.\n\nLeonard: That might work too.\n\nPenny: Goodnight Leonard.\n\nLeonard: Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.)\n\nCut to inside the apartment.\n\nRaj: He\u2019s coming. Screen saver.\n\nHoward: Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?\n\nLeonard: Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?\n\nSheldon: They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.\n\nHoward: You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.\n\nLeonard: What are you talking about, the date went fine.\n\nRaj: Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.\n\nLeonard: Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It\u2019s like saying \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying this meal, I\u2019m going to slow down and savour it.\u201d\n\nHoward: No, it\u2019s like \u201cthis fish tastes bad, so I\u2019m going to slow down and spit it out.\u201d\n\nRaj: You being the fish.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m not the fish.\n\nHoward: Oh really, did you make a second date.\n\nLeonard: Well, we sort of decided to wing it.\n\nSheldon: Oh, even I know that\u2019s lame.\n\nLeonard: Okay, alright, let\u2019s assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.\n\n Howard: Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I\u2019m getting into.\n\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t say anything like that.\n\nHoward: Good, \u2018cos they don\u2019t work.\n\nRaj: They also don\u2019t care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that\u2019s my home run swing.\n\nLeonard: Look, everything went fine. I didn\u2019t even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.\n\nHoward: Let\u2019s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.\n\nRaj: Nice close up, by the way.\n\nSheldon: Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.\n\nLeonard: That\u2019s not a bad sign.\n\nSheldon: Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.\n\nRaj: And the worst sign of all is, you\u2019re here and not there.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m not there because I\u2019m taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.\n\nRaj: He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.\n\nHoward: Give him time.\n\nCredits sequence\n\nScene: The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.\n\nPenny (entering): Hi.\n\nSheldon: Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I\u2019d avoid using that for your delicates.\n\nPenny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once): Thanks.\n\nSheldon: Oh, good Lord. Why don\u2019t you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?\n\nPenny: Sheldon, may I ask you a question?\n\nSheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I won\u2019t go so far as to forbid it.\n\nPenny: Alright, I heard yes, so\u2026 okay, here\u2019s my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.\n\nSheldon: Well I assume you\u2019re not referring to digestive regularity? Because I\u2019ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.\n\nPenny: No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn\u2019t a braniac?\n\nSheldon: Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.\n\nPenny: How is that not a braniac?\n\nSheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.\n\nPenny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he\u2019ll eventually get bored with me.\n\nSheldon: That depends.\n\nPenny: On what?\n\nSheldon: Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?\n\nPenny: No.\n\nSheldon: Do you speak Klingon?\n\nPenny: No.\n\nSheldon: Do you know any card tricks?\n\nPenny: Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.\n\nSheldon: Why would you lie about that?\n\nPenny: Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn\u2019t want him to think I was some stupid loser.\n\nSheldon: You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?\n\nPenny: You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.\n\nSheldon: Yeah, but you were neither.\n\nPenny: Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.\n\nSheldon: You\u2019re asking me to keep a secret?\n\nPenny: Yeah.\n\nSheldon: Well I\u2019m sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can\u2019t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.\n\nPenny: What?\n\nSheldon: Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It\u2019s a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.\n\nPenny: Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.\n\nSheldon: Physiologically impossible.\n\nPenny: Oh Sheldon, please, look, I\u2019m asking you as a friend.\n\nSheldon: So you\u2019re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?\n\nPenny: Well, yeah.\n\nSheldon: Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends?\n\nScene: The stairwell.\n\nSheldon: I.e, I couldn\u2019t become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.\n\nLeonard: You could be Batman?\n\nSheldon: Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I\u2019m Batman. See.\n\nPenny (arriving): Hi guys.\n\nLeonard: Hey.\n\nSheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably): Hi Penny.\n\nLeonard: Hey, Penny, if you\u2019re not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.\n\nPenny: Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.\n\nLeonard: What about Saturday?\n\nPenny: You know, I\u2019m not sure, the manager hasn\u2019t posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.\n\nLeonard: Great. So you just let me know when you know. So\u2026 (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?\n\nSheldon: Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.)\n\nLeonard (chasing him): What does that mean?\n\nSheldon: Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.\n\nLeonard: No I didn\u2019t.\n\nSheldon: I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.\n\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on with you?\n\nSheldon: Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.)\n\nLeonard: What\u2019s wrong with your face?\n\nSheldon: There\u2019s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.\n\nLeonard: What?\n\nSheldon: I said Good Day! (He leaves)\n\nLeonard: Good day?\n\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory\n\nPenny: Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that\u2019s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day\u2026\n\nSheldon (appearing behind her): You must release me from my oath.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, I\u2019m working.\n\nSheldon: Why don\u2019t you take a minute to decide (leads her away) I can\u2019t keep your secret Penny. I\u2019m going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.\n\nPenny: Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m constitutionally incapable. That\u2019s why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.\n\nPenny: Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?\n\nSheldon: Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven\u2019t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.\n\nPenny: Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you\u2019re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.\n\nScene: The apartment.\n\nSheldon (entering): Leonard, I\u2019m moving out.\n\nLeonard: What do you mean, you\u2019re moving out? Why?\n\nSheldon: There doesn\u2019t have to be a reason.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, there kind of does.\n\nSheldon: Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen\u2019s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it\u2019s ultimately circular, i.e., I\u2019m moving out because I\u2019m moving out.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m still confused.\n\nSheldon: Leonard, I don\u2019t see how I could have made it any simpler.\n\nHoward (entering): Hey, qu\u2019est q\u2019wass up?\n\nRaj: We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.\n\nHoward: And some of those skinless chicks were hot.\n\nSheldon: If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to pack.\n\nHoward: That\u2019s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s not you, Howard, he says he\u2019s moving out.\n\nRaj: What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?\n\nLeonard: No.\n\nRaj: Did you take a band aid off in front of him?\n\nLeonard: No.\n\nHoward: Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?\n\nRaj: Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?\n\nLeonard: No.\n\nHoward: Did you make fun of trains?\n\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t do anything, he\u2019s just gone insane.\n\nRaj: Well, we all knew this day was coming.\n\nLeonard: That was fast.\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor.\n\nLeonard: Where are you gonna live?\n\nSheldon: Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.\n\nHoward: Bye (runs out.)\n\nRaj: Well you can\u2019t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.\n\nSheldon: Excuse me, but isn\u2019t hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?\n\nRaj: I hate trains.\n\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous, you love trains.\n\nRaj: Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)\n\nLeonard: This could work.\n\nScene: Raj\u2019s apartment.\n\nSheldon: This is a very old building.\n\nRaj: Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.\n\nSheldon: Uh-oh.\n\nRaj: What?\n\nSheldon: Don\u2019t you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?\n\nRaj: Not until now.\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn\u2019t pack it.\n\nRaj: Well, if you\u2019re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon\u2026\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.\n\nRaj: Terrific.\n\nSheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television): Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?\n\nRaj: Yes, isn\u2019t she an amazing actress.\n\nSheldon: Actually, I\u2019d say she\u2019s a poor man\u2019s Madhuri Dixit.\n\nRaj: How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.\n\nSheldon: Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you. Obviously you\u2019re not that familiar with Indian cinema.\n\nScene: Howard\u2019s house. The door rings.\n\nHoward: Who is it?\n\nVoice: Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.)\n\nRaj: Tag. You\u2019re it. (Runs away.)\n\nHoward: Shouldn\u2019t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?\n\nScene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.\n\nHoward: Maybe you\u2019d be happier on a park bench?\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t see any way to get a park bench in here.\n\nHoward: Do you want to switch?\n\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.\n\nHoward: Get out of bed, we\u2019re switching.\n\nSheldon: Now, only if you want to.\n\nHoward: Just get in the bed!\n\nHoward\u2019s mother (off): What\u2019s going on? Are you boys roughhousing?\n\nHoward: We\u2019re just talking ma.\n\nHoward\u2019s mother: If you don\u2019t settle down right now, I\u2019m not going to let you have any more sleepovers.\n\nHoward: For God\u2019s sake, ma, I\u2019m 27 years old. It\u2019s not even a school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now?\n\nSheldon: Meh. That poster of Halle Berry\u2019s a little unnerving.\n\nHoward: So don\u2019t look at it.\n\nSheldon: She\u2019s like my fourth favourite catwoman.\n\nHoward: No kidding?\n\nSheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.\n\nHoward: What about Lee Meriwether?\n\nSheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.\n\nHoward: Well I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled.\n\nSheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There\u2019s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether\u2026\n\nHoward: Please, I\u2019m begging you, go to sleep.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.\n\nHoward: Oh for God\u2019s sake.\n\nSheldon: But she\u2019s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel\u2026.\n\nScene: Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment. There is an urgent rapping at the door.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)\n\nSheldon: Hey, there he is, there\u2019s my old buddy-bud-bud.\n\nLeonard: What\u2019s with him?\n\nHoward: Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn\u2019t get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom\u2019s valium in it. But he still wouldn\u2019t shut up, so, tag, you\u2019re it.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m ba-ack!\n\nLeonard: I still don\u2019t know why you left.\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t tell you.\n\nLeonard: Why not.\n\nSheldon: I promised Penny.\n\nLeonard: You promised Penny what?\n\nSheldon: That I wouldn\u2019t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!\n\nLeonard: What secret. Tell me the secret.\n\nSheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can\u2019t tell Dad.\n\nLeonard: Not that secret, the other secret.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m Batman. Shhhhh!\n\nLeonard: Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.\n\nSheldon: Okay, I\u2019ll tell you, but you can\u2019t tell Leonard.\n\nLeonard: I promise.\n\nSheldon: Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she\u2019s not smart enough for Leonard.\n\nLeonard: So it\u2019s nothing I did? It\u2019s her problem?\n\nSheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny.\n\nLeonard: Penny thinks I\u2019m too smart for her, that\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nSheldon: I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s not a secret. Everybody knows.\n\nScene: The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny\u2019s door.\n\nPenny (opening door): Hi.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, hi, listen, I know what\u2019s been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.\n\nPenny: What are you talking about.\n\nLeonard: First I want to say that it\u2019s not Sheldon\u2019s fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn\u2019t drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.\n\nPenny: He told you?\n\nLeonard: Yes, but it\u2019s okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there\u2019s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.)\n\nPenny: Pasadena city college?\n\nLeonard: A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here\u2019s playing hacky sack, and this girl\u2019s going to be a paralegal.\n\nPenny: Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can\u2019t date a girl without a fancy college degree.\n\nLeonard: Well, it\u2019s really not that fancy, it\u2019s just a city college.\n\nPenny: Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?\n\nLeonard: That doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\n\nPenny: So, it\u2019s fine with you if I\u2019m not smart.\n\nLeonard: Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me!",
    "Penny: Whatcha doing?\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.\n\nPenny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You\u2019ve been up all night?\n\nSheldon: Is it morning?\n\nPenny: Yes.\n\nSheldon: Then I\u2019ve been up all night.\n\nPenny: And you\u2019re stuck?\n\nSheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?\n\nPenny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can\u2019t help you till I\u2019ve had my coffee.\n\nLeonard: Penny, I told you if you don\u2019t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.\n\nPenny: What is he doing now?\n\nLeonard: Mmm, he\u2019s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.\n\nSheldon: Captain Hook\u2019s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you\u2019re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.\n\nLeonard: Aye, aye, Captain.\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t see it! It just won\u2019t coalesce.\n\nLeonard: Maybe you need a fresh start.\n\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It\u2019s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.\n\nCredits sequence.\n\nScene: The cafeteria.\n\nSheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass\u2026\n\nHoward: How long has he been stuck?\n\nLeonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.\n\nSheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.\n\nHoward: Have you tried rebooting him?\n\nLeonard: No, I think it\u2019s a firmware problem.\n\nRaj (arriving): Hey, it\u2019s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who\u2019s up for getting down?\n\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s perfect. Bernadette\u2019s been hocking me to take her roller skating.\n\nLeonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.\n\nHoward: What could be better? We\u2019re in.\n\nRaj: Great. It\u2019s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.\n\nHoward: You can come with us.\n\nRaj: No, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to go. I\u2019m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I\u2019m a walking brown Yelp.com.\n\nSheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom\u2026\n\nHoward: Boy, he\u2019s really gone, isn\u2019t he?\n\nLeonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.\n\nHoward: I thought I smelled popcorn.\n\nSheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it\u2019s always hexagonal\u2026\n\nLeonard: I haven\u2019t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.\n\nRaj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate): Hey, those are my lima beans!\n\nSheldon: Not lima beans, carbon atoms.\n\nRaj: But if I don\u2019t eat my lima beans, I can\u2019t have my cookie.\n\nLeonard: Here, you want my peas?\n\nSheldon: Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.\n\nHoward: Want my corn?\n\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?\n\nLeonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?\n\nHoward: Good. P.F. Chang\u2019s? My mom has coupons.\n\nLeonard: Great. Your mom\u2019s not coming, right?\n\nHoward: Not this time, I promise.\n\nRaj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I\u2019m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.\n\nSheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.\n\nRaj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.\n\nScene: The stairwell.\n\nBernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?\n\nPenny: Not recently.\n\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.\n\nPenny: For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.\n\nLeonard: You had some nice moves out there, Howard.\n\nHoward: Thanks. You, too.\n\nLeonard: Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?\n\nHoward: Not really. I was in my boogie zone.\n\nBernadette: When Howard tried to do the splits\u2026\n\nPenny: Shh.\n\nLeonard: Sorry. I\u2019m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.\n\nPenny: Oh, poor baby.\n\nLeonard: Don\u2019t tell Koothrappali. After you.\n\nPenny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles which are all over the floor, screams and falls)\n\nLeonard: Oh, my God! Are you\u2026 (falls as well)\n\nSheldon: Good Lord! You\u2019re ruining everything!\n\nPenny: Oh, damn.\n\nLeonard: Are you okay?\n\nPenny: Do I look okay?\n\nLeonard: Don\u2019t bark at me. I fell, too.\n\nPenny: Oh, you\u2019ve been falling all night. You\u2019re used to it.\n\nHoward: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\n\nSheldon: The same thing I\u2019ve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.\n\nBernadette: With marbles?\n\nSheldon: Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn\u2019t I?\n\nBernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know, two, three days. Not important. I don\u2019t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.\n\nPenny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?\n\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s a crazy thing.\n\nBernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don\u2019t get enough REM sleep?\n\nSheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.\n\nBernadette: Which leads to\u2026?\n\nSheldon: Impaired cognitive function.\n\nBernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.\n\nSheldon: But I don\u2019t want to go to bed.\n\nBernadette: I\u2019m going to count to three. One\u2026\n\nSheldon: Oh, all right.\n\nLeonard: That was amazing how you handled him.\n\nBernadette: I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.\n\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.\n\nPenny: Leonard, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re giggling in your sleep.\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.\n\nPenny: Well, it creeps me out.\n\nLeonard: Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.\n\nPenny: Just answer the phone.\n\nLeonard: Hello. Yeah, I\u2019m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he\u2019s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I\u2019ll be right there.\n\nPenny: What happened?\n\nLeonard: Sheldon\u2019s escaped and is terrorizing the village.\n\nPenny: Okay. Have fun.\n\nScene: A children\u2019s play area.\n\nLeonard: Hi. I\u2019m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?\n\nSecurity Guard: Ball pit.\n\nLeonard: Thanks for not calling the cops.\n\nSecurity Guard: Oh, hey, it\u2019s no big deal. My sister\u2019s got a kid who\u2019s special.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, well, he\u2019s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?\n\nSheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn\u2019t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.\n\nLeonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?\n\nSheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child\u2019s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.\n\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t think so. We need to go home now.\n\nSheldon: But I\u2019m still working.\n\nLeonard: If you don\u2019t come out of there, I\u2019m going to have to drag you out.\n\nSheldon: You can try, but you\u2019ll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)\n\nLeonard: For God\u2019s sakes. Sheldon, come here!\n\nSheldon (popping his head up): Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.\n\nScene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed. He knocks on the wall.\n\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\n\nLeonard (Waking up as Penny screams): What! What, what, what?\n\nSheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.\n\nLeonard: What?\n\nSheldon: I have good news.\n\nLeonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?\n\nSheldon: Your cell phone was off.\n\nLeonard: Because we didn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\n\nSheldon: And that didn\u2019t work out, did it?\n\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you want?\n\nSheldon: I came to tell you I\u2019ve got the answer.\n\nLeonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?\n\nSheldon: No, no, I\u2019m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.\n\nPenny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We\u2019re going to have to break up.\n\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\n\nPenny (as Sheldon sits on the bed): Oh.\n\nSheldon: Einstein.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, I\u2019m going to need a little more.\n\nSheldon: Albert Einstein.\n\nLeonard: Keep going.\n\nSheldon: When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.\n\nLeonard: So, you\u2019re going to go work at the patent office?\n\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be absurd. That\u2019s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I\u2019m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.\n\nLeonard: Sounds like a great plan.\n\nSheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.\n\nLeonard: Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.\n\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you\u2019re on your back.\n\nPenny: Leonard doesn\u2019t snore.\n\nSheldon: No, I wasn\u2019t talking to Leonard.\n\nLeonard: Told you.\n\nScene: An employment office\n\nEmployment Office Assistant: So, Mr. Cooper, you\u2019re looking for a job.\n\nSheldon: A menial job. Like yours.\n\nAssistant: Why, thank you for noticing. I\u2019m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?\n\nSheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?\n\nAssistant: No.\n\nSheldon: Shouldn\u2019t you check your database?\n\nAssistant (clicks her keyboard a few times): No.\n\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t really type.\n\nAssistant: I didn\u2019t really have to. So, how about construction?\n\nSheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.\n\nAssistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.\n\nSheldon: I could do that.\n\nAssistant: Good.\n\nSheldon: One question.\n\nAssistant: Yes?\n\nSheldon: What\u2019s sheetrock?\n\nAssistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?\n\nSheldon: That seems acceptable.\n\nAssistant: Do you have your own car?\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drive.\n\nAssistant: Of course you don\u2019t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?\n\nSheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman\u2019s terms, string theory.\n\nAssistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!\n\nScene: The Cheesecake Factory.\n\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019ll get those drinks started for you.\n\nSheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray): Behind you.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying to get these tables cleared. We\u2019re slammed.\n\nPenny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?\n\nSheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don\u2019t like touching other people\u2019s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.\n\nPenny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?\n\nSheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I don\u2019t need to be paid, I didn\u2019t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.\n\nSheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.\n\nBernadette: Thanks, Sheldon.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, wait, this isn\u2019t even what I do. I\u2019m a waitress, not a busboy.\n\nSheldon: You\u2019re right. That is more menial. Hello, I\u2019m Sheldon. I\u2019ll be your server today. I don\u2019t recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.\n\nScene: The same, later.\n\nSheldon: All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here\u2019s your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It\u2019s a little unconventional, but I think you\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon app\u00e9tit.\n\nLeonard: Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?\n\nSheldon: Yes.\n\nLeonard: Double guacamole?\n\nSheldon: Of course.\n\nLeonard: No cilantro?\n\nSheldon: Nope.\n\nLeonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?\n\nSheldon: Yep.\n\nLeonard: You understand why I\u2019m doing this to you?\n\nSheldon: I do.\n\nLeonard: That\u2019ll be all. That was fun.\n\nRaj: How long can he keep this up?\n\nLeonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.\n\nRaj: He never went back to the university?\n\nLeonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg\u2019s shih tzu.\n\nRaj: Sheesh.\n\nHoward: I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.\n\nRaj: But he\u2019s afraid of dogs.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s the only thing wrong with that plan.\n\nPenny: Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What\u2019s this?\n\nLeonard: Sheldon took our order.\n\nPenny: Sheldon doesn\u2019t work here.\n\nLeonard: Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn\u2019t either.\n\nSheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps): Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I\u2019ve been looking at it all wrong. I can\u2019t consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It\u2019s a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, where are you going? Aren\u2019t you going to clean this up?\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t work here.\n\nScene: The roller disco.\n\nHoward: Happy now?\n\nRaj: I\u2019m on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several times.)\n\nScene: The ball pit, presumably earlier.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, come here.\n\n(Sheldon once again keeps popping up his head and shouting \u201cBazinga\u201d as Leonard flails around trying to catch him.)",
    "Sheldon: Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?\n\nPoliceman: Here. Breathe into this bag.\n\nLeonard: What\u2019s going on?\n\nSheldon: They stole everything, Leonard, everything.\n\nPoliceman: Are you the roommate?\n\nLeonard: Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?\n\nPoliceman: Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.\n\nLeonard: Oh, my God, what did they get?\n\nSheldon: What didn\u2019t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.\n\nLeonard: You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?\n\nSheldon: What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.\n\nPoliceman: Into the bag.\n\nSheldon: They took my battle ostrich.\n\nLeonard: Oh, no, not Glenn?\n\nSheldon: Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.\n\nPoliceman: Good luck, fellas.\n\nLeonard: Thank you, officer.\n\nSheldon: Wait a minute! You\u2019re not going to do anything?\n\nPoliceman: Mr. Cooper, there\u2019s nothing\u2026\n\nSheldon: Doctor Cooper.\n\nPoliceman: Seriously?\n\nLeonard: Not the kind with access to drugs.\n\nPoliceman: Fine. Dr. Cooper. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction in Pandora.\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?\n\nPoliceman: What?\n\nSheldon: You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?\n\nPoliceman: No.\n\nLeonard: Thank you, officer.\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s all gone. All gone.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m really sorry, Sheldon.\n\nSheldon: What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man\u2019s battle ostrich?\n\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know.\n\nSheldon: This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019m on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.\n\nSheldon: See if Raj is done with Pilates.\n\nCredits sequence.\n\nScene: The apartment.\n\nSheldon: Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It\u2019s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.\n\nHoward: Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn\u2019t leave a digital fingerprint.\n\nSheldon: Oh! There isn\u2019t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.\n\nRaj: Hold on. I\u2019m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he\u2019ll help us track down your things.\n\nSheldon: Can we trust him?\n\nRaj: I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.\n\nHoward: Whoa! Somebody\u2019s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!\n\nSheldon: No. Glenn\u2019s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven\u2019t given up hope.\n\nPenny: Hey.\n\nLeonard: Hey, Penny. We\u2019re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.\n\nPenny: Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.\n\nSheldon: That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing\u2026 all right, technically it\u2019s a game.\n\nRaj: Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.\n\nPenny: Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!\n\nSheldon: Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.\n\nPenny: Just say thank you.\n\nSheldon: I thought I just did.\n\nPenny: All right. See you later.\n\nPriya: Oh! Hello.\n\nPenny: Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that\u2019s useful in a make-believe place.\n\nPriya: I don\u2019t know what that means.\n\nPenny: Yeah, well, sadly, I do.\n\nScene: Penny\u2019s apartment.\n\nPenny: Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?\n\nBernadette: I feel like I\u2019m supposed to say that bitch, but I don\u2019t have enough information.\n\nPenny: I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.\n\nBernadette: I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.\n\nPenny: So what\u2019s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.\n\nAmy: I think you\u2019re on.\n\nBernadette: Oh. That bitch!\n\nPenny: Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?\n\nAmy: Ah, here\u2019s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.\n\nPenny: You guys should\u2019ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.\n\nAmy: I\u2019m drunk.\n\nPenny: You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.\n\nBernadette: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m never speaking to Priya again.\n\nPenny: No, don\u2019t do that. No reason to be mean to her.\n\nAmy: This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?\n\nPenny: No, but I can name all the Kardashians.\n\nAmy: Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette\u2019s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.\n\nBernadette: I don\u2019t have an urge to fling my waste.\n\nAmy: Believe me, it\u2019s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I\u2019ll show you.\n\nScene: The apartment\n\nHoward: All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.\n\nRaj: I don\u2019t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone\u2019s undressing her with their eyes.\n\nHoward: Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.\n\nLeonard: Okay, what exactly are we looking for?\n\nHoward: Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it\u2019s after school hours, he\u2019s your guy.\n\nPriya: Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.\n\nLeonard: Uh, we are. In the meantime, you\u2019re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.\n\nPriya: Seriously?\n\nLeonard: Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it\u2019s fun.\n\nPriya: Maybe I should just go home.\n\nHoward: Our troll just walked in! I got him!\n\nLeonard: We got him. We\u2019re almost done.\n\nHoward: So, how do you guys want to play this?\n\nSheldon: Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn\u2019t start talking, we\u2019ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.\n\nRaj: Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m losin\u2019 it, man!\n\nLeonard: Why don\u2019t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.\n\nPriya: Oh, dear Lord.\n\nHoward: Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.\n\nRaj: Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I\u2019ll have sex with him.\n\nLeonard: That\u2019s not where it was going.\n\nRaj: Good, because I would hate that.\n\nPriya: Leonard, you\u2019re busy, let\u2019s talk tomorrow.\n\nLeonard: Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?\n\nPriya: No, no, I think it\u2019s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man\u2019s body.\n\nLeonard: Good, good. I\u2019ll tell you what happens.\n\nSheldon: And people think I don\u2019t get sarcasm.\n\nScene: The hallway.\n\nAmy: Well, well, well. Look who it is.\n\nPenny: Okay, be nice.\n\nPriya: Hello.\n\nPenny: Hi. We\u2019re just heading out for a drink.\n\nAmy: Because I do that now.\n\nBernadette: Count your blessings you\u2019re not a Tanzanian chimp.\n\nPriya: What?\n\nPenny: Don\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?\n\nPriya: Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.\n\nAmy: Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?\n\nScene: The cafeteria.\n\nLeonard: Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?\n\nRaj: Oh, no, don\u2019t put me in the middle of this. I\u2019m not going to be your go-between.\n\nLeonard: Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?\n\nRaj: There\u2019s no reason to worry.\n\nLeonard: That\u2019s a relief.\n\nRaj: I\u2019m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.\n\nHoward: Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.\n\nSheldon: What?\n\nLeonard: Really?\n\nHoward: Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!\n\nHoward: Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.\n\nSheldon: The name and the address drip with evil.\n\nRaj: What else do we know about him?\n\nHoward: Well, quite a bit, actually.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s some loser who lives with his parents.\n\nHoward: Yes, he does live with his parents. Here\u2019s a Google Earth shot of their house.\n\nSheldon: Excellent! It\u2019s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.\n\nLeonard: Hold on, you\u2019re thinking of going there?\n\nSheldon: Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.\n\nLeonard: Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.\n\nLeonard: No one\u2019s getting tortured.\n\nSheldon: Fine, we\u2019ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?\n\nRaj: I totally had one of those.\n\nSheldon: Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who\u2019s with me?\n\nRaj: I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?\n\nSheldon: Sure.\n\nHoward: Also, tonight\u2019s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and\n\nwatching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we\u2019d still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.\n\nSheldon: Fine. Leonard?\n\nLeonard: Oh, geez, I don\u2019t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.\n\nRaj: Oh, come on, man. Bros before\u2026 my sister.\n\nLeonard: Aw, screw it. I\u2019m in.\n\nRaj: Me, too.\n\nHoward: And me.\n\nSheldon: One moment. (Places a tissue on their hands before adding his own) I\u2019m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.\n\nScene: Howard\u2019s house\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.\n\nHoward: I am. She\u2019s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N\u2019s, one V.\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (off): Fanny pack of wolves.\n\nLeonard: That\u2019s incredible.\n\nHoward: Yeah, she\u2019s kind of a Wheel savant.\n\nLeonard (phone rings): Uh-oh, that\u2019s Priya.\n\nRaj: Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.\n\nLeonard: Hit the\u2026 Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I\u2019ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.\n\nRaj: Very nice. You lie to my sister.\n\nHoward: That\u2019s the nicest thing he does to your sister.\n\nRaj (phone rings): Oh, guess who.\n\nLeonard: Cover for me.\n\nRaj: Hello, Priya. What\u2019s up? How would I know if Leonard\u2019s at work or not? Don\u2019t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you\u2019re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.\n\nHoward: New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D\u2019s, three O\u2019s.\n\nHoward\u2019s Mother (off): Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s uncanny.\n\nHoward: I know. It\u2019s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.\n\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\n\nLeonard: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.\n\nHoward: Yeah, we\u2019re kind of bad-asses, aren\u2019t we?\n\nLeonard: Totally.\n\nRaj: Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?\n\nSheldon: Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let\u2019s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.\n\nRaj: Yeah, we\u2019re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.\n\nSheldon: I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?\n\nRaj: I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.\n\nSheldon: This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.\n\nRaj: It\u2019s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.\n\nHoward: Beyonce? Really?\n\nRaj: She\u2019s curvy and she owns it. I like that.\n\nLeonard (as Ride of the Valkyries begins): Oh, yeah, I\u2019m feeling it.\n\nSheldon: We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.\n\nScene: Stuck in a traffic tailback.\n\nHoward: Next time we go to kick someone\u2019s ass, we take the train.\n\nSheldon: I always prefer the train.\n\nScene: Outside Todd Zarnecki\u2019s house.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, let\u2019s go.\n\nSheldon: Coming.\n\nHoward: Why did you bring that?\n\nSheldon: No weapon strikes more fear into a man\u2019s heart than a Klingon bat\u2019leth.\n\nLeonard: Okay, let\u2019s get clear on something. We\u2019re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one\u2019s bat\u2019lething anybody.\n\nSheldon: So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?\n\nLeonard: No.\n\nSheldon: Well, now I just feel silly holding it.\n\nLeonard: Come on.\n\nSheldon: Can I at least kick down the door?\n\nLeonard: You\u2019re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. (Rings bell)\n\nVoice Inside: Who is it?\n\nSheldon: Your doom!\n\nRaj: Don\u2019t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?\n\nSheldon: Good point. Basket of puppies.\n\nHuge man (opening door): What?\n\nLeonard: Uh, Sheldon?\n\nSheldon: Are you Todd Zarnecki?\n\nTodd: Yeah. Who are you?\n\nSheldon: I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.\n\nTodd: I don\u2019t think so. Let me see that.\n\nSheldon: Careful. That\u2019s a collectible.\n\nTodd: I know. I\u2019ve always wanted one. (Closes door)\n\nSheldon: Well, he\u2019s even more cunning than we thought.\n\nScene: Leonard\u2019s car.\n\nSheldon: You know, the joke\u2019s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat\u2019leth is worthless.\n\nHoward: Yeah, he walked right into our trap.\n\nRaj: Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.\n\nLeonard: Oh-oh.\n\nRaj: What\u2019s the matter?\n\nLeonard: Something\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?\n\nSheldon: Of course.\n\nRaj: Very basic.\n\nHoward: 19th-century technology.\n\nLeonard: Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?\n\nSheldon: No.\n\nHoward: No, not a clue.\n\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019d better call somebody to come pick us up.\n\nSheldon: It\u2019d be swell if they had a train.\n\nScene: Penny\u2019s car.\n\nSheldon: Thank you, Penny.\n\nPenny: No problem. So, Leonard, I think it\u2019s interesting you didn\u2019t call your girlfriend to come get you.\n\nLeonard: Uh, I kind of told her I was working.\n\nPenny: So you lied to her. Also interesting.\n\nLeonard: Yeah, she doesn\u2019t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.\n\nPenny: Well, doesn\u2019t matter if she gets it, as long as she\u2019s pretty.\n\nHoward: This one\u2019s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn\u2019t make it work with her?\n\nPenny: So did you at least get Sheldon\u2019s fake stuff back?\n\nSheldon: No. We failed in our noble quest.\n\nPenny: How come?\n\nSheldon: Todd Zarnecki was mean.\n\nPenny: All right. Hang on.\n\nLeonard: What are you doing?\n\nPenny: I\u2019m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. (Ride of the Valkyries) This ain\u2019t no Beyonce.\n\nScene: Todd Zarnecki\u2019s house. Todd answers the door.\n\nTodd: Now what?\n\nPenny: Give my friend his stuff back.\n\nTodd: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nPenny: Well, then, good news. Today\u2019s the day a girl\u2019s finally going to touch you in your little special place. (Kicks him in the groin) Now give him his stuff back.\n\nTodd: Okay.\n\nSheldon: We did it! I said, we.\n\nScene: The lobby.\n\nPriya: Oh, hold the door.\n\nPenny: Oh, hi.\n\nPriya: Hi.\n\nPenny: Going to see Leonard?\n\nPriya: Yes. How have you been?\n\nPenny: Fine. You?\n\nPriya: Very well, thank you.\n\n(They ascend all three flights of stairs in silence.)\n\nPenny: Alright, well great seeing you.\n\nPriya: Yeah, you too.\n\nPenny: Amy\u2019s right. I do want to fling my poop at her.",
    "My Dear Fellow Clergymen:\nWhile confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities \"unwise and untimely.\" Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.\n\nI think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against \"outsiders coming in.\" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. I am here because I have organizational ties here.\n\nBut more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their \"thus saith the Lord\" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.\n\nMoreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial \"outside agitator\" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.\n\nYou deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.\n\nIn any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiation.\n\nThen, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained. As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: \"Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?\" \"Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?\" We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the by product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.\n\nThen it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoral election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct action program could be delayed no longer.\n\nYou may well ask: \"Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.\n\nOne of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: \"Why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?\" The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\n\nWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\"\n\nWe have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, \"Wait.\" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: \"Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?\"; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \"white\" and \"colored\"; when your first name becomes \"nigger,\" your middle name becomes \"boy\" (however old you are) and your last name becomes \"John,\" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title \"Mrs.\"; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \"nobodiness\"--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: \"How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \"an unjust law is no law at all.\"\n\nNow, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an \"I it\" relationship for an \"I thou\" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.\n\nLet us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?\n\nSometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.\n\nI hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.\n\nOf course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.\n\nWe should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was \"legal\" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was \"illegal.\" It was \"illegal\" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country's antireligious laws.\n\nI must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.\n\nIn your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: \"All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.\" Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.\n\nYou speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense of \"somebodiness\" that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible \"devil.\"\n\nI have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the \"do nothingism\" of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as \"rabble rousers\" and \"outside agitators\" those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.\n\nOppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides -and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: \"Get rid of your discontent.\" Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\" Was not Amos an extremist for justice: \"Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.\" Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: \"I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.\" Was not Martin Luther an extremist: \"Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.\" And John Bunyan: \"I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.\" And Abraham Lincoln: \"This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.\" And Thomas Jefferson: \"We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .\" So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.\n\nI had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some -such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as \"dirty nigger-lovers.\" Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful \"action\" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation. Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.\n\nBut despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.\n\nWhen I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows.\n\nIn spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed.\n\nI have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: \"Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.\" In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: \"Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.\" And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.\n\nI have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: \"What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?\"\n\nYes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.\n\nThere was a time when the church was very powerful--in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being \"disturbers of the peace\" and \"outside agitators.\"' But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were \"a colony of heaven,\" called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be \"astronomically intimidated.\" By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiat",
    "Dear Parents and Guardians,      12 August 2021\n\nMy name is Mary McCatherine and I am your child\u2019s 8th grade English teacher. I am looking forward to working with your child and I am excited to help your child succeed in 8th grade. Please know that your support in this important part of your child's education is appreciated. This year students will especially need lots of patience and support from teachers and family. Cornavirus changed the way that education and information is delivered. Hopefully, this situation is temporary.\n\nThe English classes in Middle School are set up as block classes that meet every day. The block consists of two back-to-back classes that provide the time to teach both reading and writing. While in the 8th grade, students will continue to build upon the skills they have learned in the previous grades with the knowledge that we will be starting from where the students are now in their understanding of all concepts listed:  comprehension, analysis of literature, strategies for good reading and much more. We will read from all genres of literature to include: fiction, non-fiction, biography, autobiography, historical fiction, drama, poetry, mythology. \n\nPlease use this teacher for updated information, tutorial information, schedule and other information. GOOGLE CLASSROOM will be the platform to send and receive important information pertaining to lessons, expectations, communication, etc. The teacher website is also a valuable wealth of information. If you have questions or need clarification, contact me at mccatherinem@lisdtx.org More information will be provided upon students returning to school and after Chromebooks are distributed. \n\nBelow you will find my classroom expectations, the NEW TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills) that guide teaching in Texas.\n\nAgain, I am looking forward to this year of exploring reading and writing with the 8th grade students. I am praying for students to stay well and be safe this school year. Please be sure to contact the school immediatedly if you have academic or health concerns. If you would like to contact me, you can email me and I will gladly answer any questions you may have. Thank you!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary McCatherine\n\n8th Grade English Teacher\n\nLampasas Middle School",
    "Patient: Good Morning doctor.\nDoctor: Good morning! You seem pale and your voice sounds different.\nPatient: Yes doctor. I\u2019m having a temperature and even a sore throat.\nDoctor: Let me check.\nDoctor: You have a moderate fever. Let me check your temperature.\n(Doctor uses a thermometer to check the temperature of a patient by snapping around one of the fingers)\nPatient: This thermometer is different from the last one you used.\nDoctor: Yes, this is introduced newly by medical supplies companies. It\u2019s much more comfortable and doesn\u2019t need cleaning after every use.\nPatient: That\u2019s really great.\nDoctor: Yes it is.\n(Now he removed the thermometer)\nDoctor: Temperature is not too high, around 99.8. Let me check your blood pressure as well.\n(He then continues with measuring blood pressure.)\nDoctor: Your blood pressure is fine.\n(Now, he checks the throat.)\nDoctor: It seems a bit scruffy. Not good.\nPatient: Yes, it has been quite bad.\nDoctor: Do you sweat and shiver?\nPatient: Not sweating, but I feel slightly cold when I sit under a fan.\nDoctor: Ok. You have few signs of malaria. I would recommend you undergo a blood test. Nothing to worry about. In most cases, the test comes out to be negative. It\u2019s just careful, as there has been a spurt in malaria cases in the last month or so.\nDoctor: I am writing three medicines and syrup. The number of dots in front of each medicine name tells you how many times in the day you have to take them. For example, the two dots here mean you\u2019ve to take the medicine twice in the day, once in the morning and once after dinner.\nDoctor: Do you have any other questions?\nPatient: No, doctor. Thank you.",
    "Dad? Come on, we're only halfway done. I need help. I was supposed to keep a journal all summer. It's due today. Wow, first day of school, and you're already behind? [groans] I'm dead. All right, tell me how far you've gotten. Okay. \"June 21st -- found a stick.\" Mm. \"June 22nd...\" That's it. That's it? It was a really cool stick. He's right. It looked like a snake. Getting everybody out of the house in the morning can be really tough, Especially the first day of school. From the minute we get up at 7:00 Till we drop them off at school, It is go, go, go. I get up at 6:00. [chuckles] I get up at 5:00. Seriously, I get up at 6:00. That's you? I th-- I thought we had a raccoon. I can't believe my littlboy is going into the fifth grade. He used to hold my finger with his little hand And look at me with those big eyes. Oh, mi ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o, jay! Yep, they grow up. Come on, manny, let's get going! How's my hair? Hold on. What are you wearing there? That looks like an old christmas tree skirt. It's a traditional colombian poncho. I want my new classmates to know I'm proud of my heritage. S\u00ed. I think you look very handsome, lindo. Oh, really? Am I driving him to school, or is he gonna ride his burro? \u266a you are a cutie-pie, yes, you are \u266a \u266a you are a cutie-pie \u266a Are you still baby-proofing? Everything we own is pointy. Why is our daughter dressed like donna summer? She is not donna summer. Clearly, she's diana ross from the rca years. How is daddy not seeing that? I really thought you were done with this. I made no such promises. I guess I'm somewhat of a shutterbug, um, And my new favorite model, of course, is lily. I just completed a series of photographs Of her dressed as various pop icons. Let's see, I've done, uh, olivia newton-john. I've done madonna, the early years. Stevie wonder. Yeah, there are days when lily has more costume changes than cher. [gasps] cher! How could I forget cher? That's embarrassing. That's embarrassing? Honey, you moving out?Ans] Five more years. A little help here? This is why we suggested the violin. The cello is more in demand in university orchestras. You know what's not in demand? Oh, what? Girls who play in university orchestras. [laughs sarcastically] Here, I'll help you carry it out to the curb. Phil, put on some pants. Come on, this covers up more than my bathing suit. Yeah, don't reminde. Haley, honey, don't forget the driving instructor Is picking you up from school. Can't he pick me up someplace else? I don't want kids at school thinking I'm dating A 40-year-old driving instructor who's not even cute. Haley just got her learner's permit We've been taking turns driving with her. One of the really standard rules of the road Is we want to keep a safe distance Between us and the car in front of it, And that is not safe right there -- not safe. All right. Okay, merge. I -- merge. Mom -- merge! Merge, merge, merge, merge, merge! Stop it! You're freaking me out! This navigation system's all messed up. It thinks we'rin a park. Oh, my god, it is a park! Away from the kids! Where do I go?! Aim for the lake! The lake?! Aim for the lake! Makes you realize we're all just hanging by a thread. The last thing manny needs on his first day of school Is you under-melting his confidence. Undermining. Now u're doing it to me, too. I'm sorry, but there's only two places Anyone should wear a poncho -- Niagara falls and log rides. You think too much about these things. I wear all sort of daring outfits all the time, And people admire them because I wear them with the confidence. I'm sure it's the confidence they're admiring. [chuckles] I just... I just think it's a little over-the-top. You know what? You need to loosen up and have fun. I am loose. I'm fun. Remember? Breakfast for dinner last week -- my idea. Ever since we brought lily home, you've been tense. All you do is put child locks on things, read parenting books. Would you please stop and -- Here -- just hold your daughter. Hold her and relax. All right, sweetheart. Come on. Just relax. Oh, sweetheart. Did you put hair spray on this? Just a little bit, yes. I'm gonna put some music on. No, cam, I have to go to work. Dance with her! I don't have time for this. Put a little boogie in it. [dance music plays] Oh, come on. Just dance. You know you love this song. This is actually a really good song. All right. Okay. Who's the dancing queen, huh? [music continues] Put a little boogie in it. I don't have time. See? Fun, right? [thud] Oh, my -- was that her head? No, I think if it was her head, she would be -- [lily crying] Yeah, that was her head. Okay, okay. Mitchell: Yes, I know. I got boo-boo bear from the freezer. Why do you have chocolate on your face? It was under a pie. So you ate your way to it? I made a judgment call. You weren't there! Do you think she's all right? She didn't cry that much. M-maybe that's a bad sign. You know... We should try and make her laugh. Why? 'cause that's how we'll know she's okay. Where's, um... Where's doggy? Doggy, doggy. Here, doggy. Okay, there you go. Moo! But it's a dog. Yeah, I know. That's why it's funny. Moo! I don't think it's as funny as you think it is. Can we please just call your sister? No, no. Cam, cam, why, so she can be all judgmental and condescending, Like she's the expert and I don't know how to take care of a baby? Mitchell, she is your family. Of course she's gonna be judgmental and condescending. Hello? Hey, hi. Uh, not a big deal, just wondering -- When your kids were small, did you ever... I don't know, uh, smack their heads into a wall? Usually, we just gave time-outs. No, no. Accidentally. Um, we -- we just kind of bonked lily's head, And she -- it really wasn't very hard, And she's not acting any differently, But I just worry -- relax. It happens. Luke used to bang his head all the time, and he's fine. Okay. All right, thank you. Thanks. That helps. Okay, okay. We got to take her to the doctor. Load up the car. Jay: Gloria? I'm here. I, uh, just dropped manny off at school, And I realized... I just dropped manny off at school. Oh, boy. And I was hoping we'd still have a few more good years Before the mind started to go. No, what I'm saying... We have the day to ourselves for the first time in months. We should take advantage of it -- Go to the club... Nice lunch... Some massages. What about work? I'm the boss. Since I married you, people are surprised I come in at all. [chuckles] Jay's very spontaneous. He's always surprising me with little presents, Fun getaways. I wasn't the greatest husband the first time around, But I'm trying to do better this time. And maybe by my third marriage, I'll have it down pat. [chuckles] Yeah, that one's gonna cost me. Whatcha reading there, a book? Yeah, I've been meaning to get to it for a while. Oh, it's got a map at the beginning. I like it when books do that. Uh-huh. Do you have an open house this morning? I rescheduled. Thought you might like some company. Ahh. Phil: Well, the first day of school can be tough For stay-at-home moms. Now, you have to understand -- the kids are gone, The nest is empty, they are rudderless. And a lot of guys wouldn't even notice. But I'm not a lot of guys. I listen with my mind, and if you pay attention, Women will tell you what they want By telling you the opposite of what they want. Like, the other day, claire was like, \"you have to move your car. There's no space in the garage for both of our cars.\" And what she's really saying is that, you know, I should probably get a sports car. I was sort of looking forward to a quiet day. Thought I'd just read, maybe...Go for a run later. That's it. Great. We'll run together. You don't have to do that. Know. Listening. The thing is, I like to run alone, And I run kind of fast, so... So... So, I'm not sure You're gonna be able to keep up with me. [laughs] You're k-- you're kidding, right? No. You really think I can't keep up with you? I'm not sure you can keep up with this conversation. I think you're forgetting that I power-walk every morning And that I wear my special ses with the big soles, Which were designed by a doctor. Yes, I know. But I run... Every day. You really think you can run as fast as me? No, phil, I think I can run much, much faster... Than you. Boom. Just like that, the whole day changed. It was game on. She knew it. I knew it. We both knew it. [sighs] I just want to read. I think I'll order what I had the last time. What was that called? You just want me to say it because you want me to roll my r's. Come on! [trilling] Reuben. [laughs] Jay, what is this? Oh, looks like my old car cover. Don't give me that. This is manny's poncho. What is it doing here? Maybe he decided to take it off on the way to school. What did you say to him? Nothing. I told some jokes. You said plenty with your jokes. Jay, he looks up to you. He respects your opinion. We dodged a bullet on this, trust me. I've been down this road before. I remember one time mitchell decided to wear A jaunty scarf to school. I kept my mouth shut. He got his jaunty butt kicked. My dad has this perception that I was very flamboyant as a kid, Which is just -- it's nonsense, Because I kept the whole g@y thing very under wraps. You know, I was just a guy's guy. I-I was basically a jock. You know? So, we should crush manny's spirit And destroy everything that makes him who he is. I'm just sing, it's no fun To see your kid get picked on every day, Getting tormented just because he's different. Now, I'm telling you, it rips your heart out. Well, batman doesn't get picked on, and he wears a cape. A poncho is just a cape that goes all the way around. Batman doesn't get picked on because he's a muscular genius. Manny can't make it to the top bunk. We're taking this poncho to manny at school. It's important that he knows that we support m. And then we go get those massages. That sounded good. I always take the stairs two at a time. I don't even think about it anymore. The regular way would seem weird. Phil, let it go. I'm faster than you. If only there was some way we could settle this Once and for all, but how? Huh. You seriously want to race me? I ran a half marathon last year. Wow. I'm half scared. Okay, we do need to do this. I'll go change. Not now. I got a conference call. But how about after that? Great. This afternoon. Sweet! Two at a time, two at a time, two at a -- Son of a gun, got to fix that step. Two at a time, already at the top, so... Hi. I'm dr. Miura. I'm on call today. Looks like we have a little head bump. Yeah, it happened a couple hours ago on a doorjamb. Oh, ouch. We used to do this thing in school Where they would give you an egg, And you -- you know, you couldn't break it. And it was supposed to teach you how hard it was to be a parent. But... The real thing, it's -- it's -- it's so much harder. We did that in my school, too. It didn't turn out so well. Went through a dozen eggs. Yeah, well, he's a nervous eater. No, I broke a dozen eggs. Oh. I'm sorry. I just assumed that -- I know. I know what you assumed. There doesn't seem to be any mark. Well, her head was... Somewhat protected. Protected? Was she wearing a hat? Yes, yes. It was like a hat. It was a wig. Actually, sort of a ghetto-fabulous afro thing. I thought it might be medically relevant. Really? You thought \"ghetto-fabulous\" might be medically relevant? Maybe I should just finish with the exam? Yes. Thanks. You'll be pleased to know That mitchell and I intend on raising lily With influences from her asian heritage. That is fantastic. Have you noticed any vomiting since the head bump? Uh, no. No, no. We've hung some art in her room, some asian art, And then when she's ready for solid food, There is a fantastic pho place Right around the corner from our house. Am I pronouncing that right? Is it \"pho\"? [fuh] It's a soup. I don't know. I'm from denver. We don't have a lot of...Pho there. Just to be sure, Could you show me how hard lily got hit? And u-- use your head. Oh, yeah, so, I mean, really, it was... It was just sort of like, um... Could I see that again? Um, it was just -- just a head bump, you know? How are you feeling? Uh, fine. So is lily. Babies are designed to survive new parents. So stop worrying. You guys are doing great. Thank you. Denver. I don't see any ponchos, Which means either the kids don't wear them Or the ones who do wear them disappear. We're doing the right thing. I support manny no matter what. Children need to know that you believe in them. It's the most important thing. If you tell them they have wings, They will believe they can fly. Oh, really? I had a buddy went to woodstock, Believed he could fly -- didn't end great. It's why hotel windows don't open anymore. Is something wrong? Who's died? No one, manny. Why would you even think that? In colombia, manny went to pablo escobar elementary school. If you were pulled out of class, It was definitely to identify a body. Well, we got your poncho here. I thought you said it made me look like My neck was wearing a dress. That was a joke. Oh, good it's still in the pocket. What do you got there, buddy? My pan flute. I'm going to play some colombian folk music For my new classmates. Huh. Great. I've never been more proud of you. I'm sure your friends are gonna love it. Break the flute. What? The poncho by itself is fine. The poncho plus the flute plus the stupid dance -- My son will die a virgin. That's right. Hey, sport, can I take a look at that whistle? Oh, geez, look at that! And now you stepped on it! What? Oh, darn! Wh-what's wrong with me?! Here, let me get it. Thank you. You know what, actually, maybe you should do this. Why? I-I don't want to bump her head against the door, You know, pinch her with the seat belt. Mitchell, how long are you gonna beat yourself up over one mistake? Is this gonna be like the bld highlights all over again? I just... I think I suck at being a father. What are you talking about? We're new at this. Yeah, but you're such a natural. I mean, look at you. You walk into the room, and she lights up. You -- you change her diaper with one hand. I -- nice. I'm actually jealous of you. There are so many things that you do that I can't. You -- you baby-proofed the entire house. You took care of all the adoption paperwork. Without you, we wouldn't even have a baby to injure. Just a couple of forms. Actually, that was a lot of paperwork. And you got her on all those preschool waiting lists. I can't believe you were gonna wait until she was old enough. You see, that's what makes us a great team. We each have our own strengths. Now... Who are amazing parents? We are. I can't hear you. We are! Don't you forget it. Okay. Did we just lock our baby in the car? Did you put the keys in the bag?! I put the keys in the bag. That's what we always -- Oh, mitchell, I told you not to put the keys in the bag! Don't freak out. Come on, don't freak out! Lily, it's okay! \u266a a, b, c, d, e, f, g \u266a What, are you singing to her? People get arrested for this, mitchell! We have to keep her calm. \u266a h, I, j, k, l, m, n, o, p \u266a Do all four doors lock?! Do you have a phone?! [dance music playing] what? I didn't say anything. I couldn't hear you. I'm cranking one of my mash-ups. Oh. Hey, hey! There they are. How was the first day back in prison? Fine. Yeah. What are youuys doing? Your mom and I are racing to the mailbox on sequoia and back. Why? I don't know. Oh, she knows. Hey, buddy, as soon as I'm done kicking a little mom butt here, How about I school you in some mariokart? Can't. Got to work on my journal. Lame! Hey, uh, alex, you? I have a history paper. Well, if you want see a little history Being made right here -- not really. Okay. [door closes] Ready? Are you? I was born ready. I came out of the womb wearing tiny, little, golden... Go! ...Wings. I'm breaking the window! Trina: Emergency assistance. This is trina. Help! We locked our baby in the car, and people are judging us! I swear to god, I'm gonna break it! Do not break the window! You'll get glass on her! Sir, please tell your wife to relax. Everything is going to be okay. That's a man. Really? Don't worry, lily! Lily, daddy's coming for you! Sir, we just sent the signal. The door should be unlocked now. Check -- check the door. Check the door, check the door. It's not unlocked! Oh! [panting] oh. Okay. That is amazing. How did they do that? I don't know. It's just -- We got it. Thank you. Did that come from space? Claire: I run five miles a day. I have a resting heart rate of 48. There is no way I'm going to lose a two-mile race To johnny ski pole. [breathing heavily] Just saving my energy... Drafting off of you. You feeling cocky? Yeah, I am. [laughs] I love it! But after seeing that t-shirt, I realized something. The first day of school is tough on all my kids, Especially the one I married. Boo boo boop! Afterburners engaged! Ooh! Don't choke on my smoke! And down the stretch he goes! I don't believe it! Daddy wins! Do you believe in miracles?! U.S.A.! U.S.-- Oh, no! Claire: Oh, geez! [gasps] Oh, my -- What was that?! Was that a person?! I'm good! Dad?! I'm good! I'm good! Whoo! Are you okay? You're getting better, sweetheart. Did I lose the race to make him feel better? Maybe. But it just seemed like he could use a win today. We do strange things for the people we love. We lie to them. We lie for them. There may beome bumps along the way, But we never stop wanting the best for them. That's what makes it such a tough job... But kind of the best job in the world. What are you doing?! Keep your eyes on the road! Eyes on the road! Oh, my god! Oh, my... [siren wails] Oh. Uh-oh.Kay. All right, sweetie, this happens. Remain calm. That's the first thing. Pull over right here. I'll get out the registration. Mom, I don't like cops. Okay, pull over right there. I don't like cops. All right, there's a space right here. I can't pull over. No, I can't. You need to pull over. I can't pull over. I don't like cops. You got to pull over. No can do. I got priors. I'm speeding up. The parking ticket from the mall -- I never paid the parking ticket! Keep moving, sweetheart! Dad agrees with me -- I can speed up! [siren wails] It's not a movie, Haley! Pull over!\n",
    "Ah- Fix that step. Morning! I'm still sleeping. Happy anniversary. Hmm. And they said we wouldn't last. Yeah. Who said that? Oh, look at you. You're cute. Go ahead. Open it. What have you done? Nothing. Something. Nothing. It's a View-Master. Look inside. Oh, it's us. [Chuckles] Look at how young we are. [Chuckling] [Clicks] Oh, God, that perm. Yeah, it really framed my face. [Clicks] Why is there a picture of a bracelet? Huh. Must be some kind of a mistake. What the heck is that? Phil, you didn't. What did he- did he? Oh, my God. [Gasps] It's beautiful. Oh, sweetie, I love it. Okay, your turn. My turn? Where is it? It's on the bureau. Oh. I'm surprised I didn't see it. Where? It's there. The red envelope. Oh. So- Card. No. That's where you're wrong. I am so excited. Hey. Coupons for... five free hugs. You don't like it? Are you kidding me? I love it. It's so creative. Coupons for hugs, which are usually free. But this makes it official, which is so great. I was so proud of myself when I thought of it... because you're impossible to buy for. You never want anything. Um, things I want: Robot dog, night-vision goggles, bug vacuum, G.P.S. Watch, speakers that look like rocks. I love my wife, but she sucks at giving gifts. I'm sorry for the pay-channel language, but- Oh, yogurt maker. I can't not think of things I want. Man: \u266a Hey, hey \u266a \u266a Hey, hey Hey, hey \u266a \u266a Hey, hey Hey \u266a\u266a I can't tell if she needs a diaper change. I'd think we'd be able to tell. No, with these diapers, it's hard to tell. Triple leakage protection. LeakLock. Contours to protect her little body. No gapping or chapping. Cam, do you think that maybe we need a- Night out. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Just a few hours with a couple of adults, few drinks, no baby talk. It'll make us better parents. Stop drilling. You've struck oil. We'll get Gloria to babysit. We're going out. You got some spittle. Do I? You know who'd be fun to call? Sal. Sal. [Gasps] Ooh, raise the roof, Lily. Yeah. We're calling Sal. Sal is our very best friend in the whole wide world. The reason we love her so much... is she has absolutely no inhibitions. No. Cameron: And that's before she starts drinking. Hanging out with her... is like an Amsterdam Saturday night every day of the week. And, ironically, Sal's not allowed back into Amsterdam. Any day of the week. Gloria: Of course we would love to have the baby. All the other cousins are sleeping over tonight. The more, the merrier. Okay, see you tonight. Bye-bye. Is Haley still coming? [Phone Beeps] You're related. I will spray you with the hose. All the grandkids are coming over for Jay's Night. Family tradition. Everybody wears p.j.'s, which they love. I make my famous sloppy jays, which are really sloppy joes... but made by Jay, which they love. And then we all watch a Western together, which they don't really care for, but hey, it's Jay's Night. So, Mom, there's a party tonight at Andrew Adler's, and everybody's gonna be there. Ooh, that sounds like so much fun, but I have other plans. Oh, that's hi-larious. But I'm talking about me. That's unusual. Honey, you said you'd go to your grandfather's tonight. See, that's what's so perfect about this. Andrew only lives, like, a couple blocks away from Grandpa's. So I figured that I could go- Sweetie, you made a commitment. But I really want to go. Plus, every time I go over to Grandpa's, Manny just stares at me the whole time. Maybe if you wore a bra- Alex. What? I can't wait to go to Grandpa's. Family means everything to me. 'Cause you have no friends. No. Because I love Grandpa. And he's getting older. Who knows how many years he has left? Is Grandpa dying? Didn't they tell you? Alex, stop torturing your brother. No. Your grandfather is fine. [Quietly] For now. [Game Beeping] [Doorbell Rings] Hmm. Who could that be? You expecting someone special? [Door Opens] Thank you. Flowers too? I'm sorry. Oh, what are you apologizing for? They're gorgeous. That's too much. With the View-Master and the bracelet... and the flowers and the balloons- Balloons? They're attached to your car. [Gasps] I just don't want you to feel bad... about your little... coupons. Wait a minute. You- You thought the coupons were your only present? Are you kidding me? They aren't? No! Oh, Phil, come on. It's our anniversary. Those coupons were just, like, a fun little way to kick off the day. Your real present is coming tonight, and you're gonna love it. [Chuckles] Love it. Cool. I got nothing. I'm so screwed. Oh, this place brings back so many memories. Oh, my God! Sal! Get up! Get up! Get in here! Big bear! Oh, my baby cub! Oh, my God. Look at you. Oh! You guys notice anything different? Your hair's longer, right? No. Did you get your teeth bleached? No. Let me give you a little hint. Ba-boobs! Oh, my God. Oh, wow. Those are sensational. I know, right? You wanna touch 'em? I'm g@y, not dead. Are you okay with this? Yeah. You're drinking a passion-fruit daiquiri. I'll be fine. Okay, get in there. I'm coming in. \u266a\u266a [Gloria Singing Loudly In Spanish] So, Lily likes that, that... singing? Yes. It relaxes her. Oh, okay. \u266a\u266a [Continues] So Lily's deaf. [Doorbell Rings] [Door Opens] There are my little stinkers. Alex: Howdy. Hi, Grandpa. Come on in. Gloria: Hey. Alex: Hola. Hola, hola. Well, hello there, Haley. Take it down a notch, Jethro. So, you guys ready for some fun? What? I love you, Grandpa, and I'm never gonna forget you. Okay, okay. Back at ya, champ. Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a pajama party. Where's your p.j.'s? Yeah, they're in my bag. I need to talk to you about something. She wants to go to a party with Dylan, Grandpa. Shut up, Alex. It's at my friend Andrew Adler's. He lives three blocks from here. Oh. Walking distance. Right. So I wouldn't ask you this, because I love coming to your house, but it's kind of an important party, and I- Somebody invites you over, the last thing you wanna do is insult them. Exactly. I'm glad we agree. [Laughs] Oh, my God. That was so easy. This is awesome. You really don't understand what just happened there, do you? Jay: P.j.'s on, Haley! What? Um, I would be happy to let her change in my room. [Doorbell Rings] Hmm. Who could that be? Are you expecting someone special? What did you do? Nothing. I just know that there's someone at the door. Rock on, Phil Dunphy. Bam! Read it and weep, Phil. Oh. It's the lz. Phil: Who? Izzy LaFontaine from Spandau Ballet. Dizzy Dontaine from Spa- Hey. He's got it now. He's got it. He's just seriously freaking out. Yes! Phil loves Spandau Ballet. That song \"True\" was playing in the car the first time we kissed. It's our song. So I did some research, found out that the lead guitarist lives, like, 40 miles from here. He was in the phone book. How '80s is that? I never liked Spandau Ballet. Our entire marriage, I never once mentioned Spandau Ballet. Am I even pronouncing that right? Here to play a private concert for us is the guitarist- Bass player, actually. And lead singer- Well, backup, backup. Of Spandau Ballet. Between Richard Miller and Martin Kemp. Oh, those guys. [Chuckles] I miss you two guys so much. Oh. So, so much. To us. Yeah. To us. To us, the Three Musketeers. Whoo! Cabo! What? Seriously, you bastards. We've been talking about it forever. We're doing it. We're going to Cabo. Let's do it. Let's do it. All right. Let's go. Yeah. Yes. Yes. That would be fun. Fun? Are you joking? Margaritas, you guys, these guys. It's gonna be epic. Yeah, but we need to find someone for Lily. Okay, okay. Um, how much are you gonna pay me to go make out with the waitress? All right. Now, wait. Which one? The old one or the young one? Ooh. Ten for the young one, 20 for the old. I am about to make 30 bucks. [Squeals] I'm just gonna go check on Lily real quick. Right now? Yeah. It'll just take a second. Well, I'm just- You're gonna miss me sluttin' it up with Driving Miss Daisy. It'll just take a second. Real fast. [Sighs] You should k!ll that baby. What? You should call the baby. I love you guys so much. Did she just- I'm scared. I got nothing. I think I have a very good pair. You sure do, honey. Alex: And I got squat. I don't think I have anything either. Are you kidding me? That's a straight. Really? Jay: She wins. Alex: You won. I win. You got it, Haley. You know what? I think I deserve a soda. Manny: Good job, Haley. Alex: Did you see that? Gloria: \"I don't know how to play.\" Alex: She didn't even know. Manny: You know, she deserves it. Jay: Hi, honey. Oh! Gee, you scared me. How did you- Lightbulb went out. You don't change these right away, you never get around to it. There. Now I can see everything that goes on around here. Jay: I've had a little practice at this. Haley wasn't throwing anything at me I hadn't seen before... from her mother and then some. But nobody gets off The Rock. Right. Here's a track. Wasn't so popular in America. Got to number six on the Netherlands charts though. That whole summer I couldn't walk to the corner in Amsterdam... without mobs of birds coming up and asking me for the double bubble. Okay, just play it, I think. Yeah. \u266a\u266a [Bass] He's- He's awesome, honey. You're welcome. \u266a Tonight \u266a \u266a So right \u266a \u266a Lover \u266a Hey, Phil, I think your lover wants a kiss from you. Oh. Okay. Oh, come on, man. She's not your sister. Give her a proper snog. [Chuckles] [Laughs] Oh! Oh. \u266a\u266a [Stops] Oh. Claire: You all right? That's a bad joke. Not funny. My sister lost her feet to complications from diabetes. Okay. Can I get you some water there, guy, or- Yeah. No. You got tea? Yes, of course. I'll get that. Chamomile. You don't miss a minute. Okay. [Chuckles] Oh, God. Why did- You know, look at what I'm doing. I'm- I'm making it all about me. What a downer. No. It's your evening. Let's make it great, man. No. Name your playlist. I'll do it all. Oh, um, just the classics. Let's play the hits. We'll get to the hits, obviously. Go to the back catalog, man. Favorite B-side. That's fun. Yeah, that's fun. Uh, just- I'm so bad with titles. Hum it. \u266a\u266a [Humming] \u266a Tonight \u266a I just did that one, didn't I? Yeah. That's why it's in the noodle. So I guess- \u266a\u266a [Humming] No. What album is that on? Second. I wanna say second. What's on the cover? There's a warlock, I think, or a seascape. Warlock. Oh. Millennium Sunrise. Millennium Sunrise. Right. There is no Millennium Sunrise record. What- What? You're not a Fandau. You didn't even know who I was at the door. I saw it in your eyes. Please don't say anything to Claire. She made a mistake. Am I being punk'd? This means so much to her, and I don't wanna hurt her feelings. Her feelings? Well, what about my feelings? This is my career, man. You know, my music was the soundtrack to people's lives. Now I'm nothing. How do you think that feels? This is really humiliating. No, no, no. Don't go. Don't go. Hey. What are you guys doing? He let me touch it! Yeah, I think she said \"k!ll,\" Cam. I do. Maybe it was just a joke. She's always had a dark sense of humor. That's true. Remember her Halloween costume? When she came as Siegfried and part of Roy. It was too soon. Yeah. Yeah. This was just a joke. Yes. Yeah. Here she comes. I'm gonna bring up Lily. We'll see what she says. Show her some pictures. Pay up, bitches. [Screeches] Whoa. More drinks. Free drinks. Wow. Sal, you've got to look at these pictures. What are they? It's Lily at the zoo. Oh, cute. Look at that one. Cute! Cute. Cutie, cutie, cute, et cetera. So you guys are gonna have to bring Lily to Cabo, now that you're the guys that always bring Lily? Well, you know- Yeah, probably. I will throw her in the ocean. What? I said I gotta go pee. Okay, that wasn't even close. Nope. I mean, what do we do? Do we say something? How do we even bring it up? She threatened our child, and that's your concern- a segue? You know what this is? What? This is first-child syndrome. What? It's where the first child is happy, and then the second child comes along, and the first child gets jealous of the second child and starts acting out. Yes. That's brilliant, except Sal's not our child, so- Well, think about it. We've practically done everything for her. We've held her when she's cried. We've carried her when she couldn't walk. We've done everything but potty-train her. Um- Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. I was thinking- Oh. Oh. Sorry. When we go to Cabo, we have to find a hotel with a swim-up bar, 'cause this going back and forth to the bathroom is a fool's game. Okay, let's get more drinks. Sal, we got to talk. It's about Lily. Oh, shocker. Okay. Do you think it's at all possible... that maybe- maybe you're jealous of her? Pfft! What? What? [Laughing] It's just- I don't know. I don't- Where- Why would you say that? Well, because you won't look at any pictures of her... and you talked about k!ll!ng her and throwing her in the ocean. Okay, that was a joke, you guys. Come on. Fine. Show me the pictures of Yoko. See, it's- Sal. It's a joke. You guys! Come on. 'Cause she's Asian, and she broke up our group. I- I just- Look, let's at least acknowledge that things have changed between us. And you know what? Because Lily's here doesn't mean we love you any less. No. Absolutely not. What's wrong? We used to be really close, and you used to call me a lot. And now you never call me. Well, but we- Sal: No. And last week I had a really bad dream, and I was thinking, \"Okay, I'm gonna call them.\" And then I thought, \"Oh, no, you can't call them... because you might wake up their baby.\" You can always call. Oh, honey, always call us. No. I'm sorry we haven't been there. We're here now, okay? [Mouths Words] [Mouths Words] Okay? [Burps] Feel better? I think you just put a little- [Sal Groans] Spittle? [Mumbling] Okay. Okay. Did she just fall asleep? I wish Lily would fall asleep like that. Give her eight shots of tequila. \u266a\u266a [Gloria Singing] [Crying] I don't understand why she's not falling asleep. I have a theory. Jay: I got the movie. Manny, why don't you go fire up some popcorn? You looking for these? You took my shoes? No, I took your freedom. Sorry, kid. It ain't your night. Why are you being like this? I just wanted to go to that party for, like, two hours. I would've been back by now. Would that have killed you? She's just like her mother. Why are you treating Haley like this? Me? She's the one acting like a pill. You're taking this too personally. When I was Haley's age, I loved my grandfather, but I still wanted to go to parties and be with boys. I know. I know. So did Claire... and Mitchell. But you know what? You try to put something over on me, you're gonna lose. So, what? Now you're gonna make this into a big game? I'm trying to keep 'em around a little bit longer, that's all. I mean, who knows how many nights like this I got left? I miss you already. What's wrong with this kid tonight? Go in the kitchen and help out the guys, and I'll be right in. It's great that you wanna spend time with your granddaughter, but is this really the way? Fine. You're a good abuelo. She's upstairs. I know. Dylan! Yeah? Get up. You're here to take Haley to the party, right? Yeah. She's in the house. How did you know I was here? This is how I first met Phil. Thanks again, Grandpa. We'll be back by 11:00. I will track you down. I believe that. What's that smell? Sloppy jays. Help yourself. There's plenty left. Oh. Sloppy jays because your name's Jay. Right on. Can't believe she's into this guy. If you want, I'll fix you a plate. Yeah, definitely. That'd be great. But what about the party? We can go in just a minute. Just let- [Gunshot] Oh, no way. The Gunfighter. I love this movie. Dylan, the party. Oh. But... cowboys. Don't fight it, Haley. They never grow up. Thanks. I'm going to the kitchen for an espresso. Anybody need anything? Alex: No, thanks. Claire: Okay. Two, three, four. \u266a Ah, ha-ha, ha-ah \u266a The year was 1991. America was immersed in Desert Storm. \u266a Ah, ha-ha, ha-ah \u266a Meanwhile, stateside, another storm was brewing... in my heart. [Laughs] This is stupid, isn't it? This is- No. Is it stupid, Phil? No. Just keep- keep going, Claire. It's wonderful. Okay. \u266a Ah, ha-ha, ha-ah \u266a After a romantic dinner at Fratelli's, a certain nervous young couple shared their first kiss... as the radio played this song. \u266a So true \u266a \u266a Funny how it seems \u266a \u266a Always in time \u266a \u266a But never in line for dreams \u266a \u266a Head over heels \u266a \u266a When toe to toe \u266a \u266a This is the sound of- \u266a You know what? No. No. Sorry. Sorry. Not gonna do it. Yes. Yes. What's wrong? What's going on? Do you even know the name of this song? P- \"True.\" \"True.\" \"True.\" Right. This is false. See? I'm not gonna play \"True\" for someone who's false. See, he doesn't- He doesn't even know the band. He's not a fan, a Fandau. Yes, he does know the band. 'Cause this is our song. You love this song. Tell him this is our song. Right. Tell him, Phil. It's not our song, Claire. Our song is \"If You Leave\" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Oh! Claire: Are you sure? Pretty sure. I sang it at our wedding. Oh, I'm an idiot. Well, actually, he's the idiot. He fell in love to a break-up song. Ignore him. This is beautiful. I love it. I hate this. I hate this. You're so sweet and nice, and I can't even give you... a decent anniversary present. I love you so much, and I feel you just are never gonna know it. I know it. I know it. Yes. You do know it? You do? And this is an awesome gift. You know why? Why? You just gave us a new song. Okay. Sort of brought you back together, eh? Seems. Sort of. Yeah. Rekindled fires of a dying passion? Sure. Shot a ray of hope into this gloomy suburban lie? All right, buddy. Just play it, lzzy. Man: \u266a Ah, ha-ha, ha-ah \u266a For you, Claire. \u266a I know this \u266a \u266a Much is true \u266a \u266a Ah, ha-ha, ha-ah \u266a \u266a I know this \u266a \u266a Much is true \u266a\u266a Man On TV: Okay, partner. I knew Mr. Frazzlebottom wasn't gonna pass up a free one. [Slurping] She is so sweet. Isn't she? Like a little angel. Hmm. Let me hold her. [Grunts] Oh, thank God.

    "It was a lively night in the bar last night. I was able to watch my beloved Blues enjoy an unexpected triumph on one of the big TV screens. I raised my arms in jubilation at the end of the game and then did a mini-jig in the middle of the room \u2026 and no one batted an eyelid. As we walk into breakfast this morning someone\u2019s hosing out the bar. The door to the ladies toilet is front and centre. It's adorned with a colourful \"sheilas\" sign, and there's a pair of buffalo horns mounted on the wall above it. The men's, by contrast, is down the end of a dark corridor and has a very small and respectable looking \u201dgentlemens\u201d sign perched discretely above its entrance. I\u2019m not quite sure what message we should be taking from this.....\n\nToday we head off for an overnight stay out at the Bungle Bungles, which are about a one hour plane flight south of Kununurra, and are the main feature of the Purnululu National Park. We\u2019re joined by three other fellow expeditioners. Pat and Kathy are fellow refugees from the southern winter, from Orange in the southern highlands of New South \n\nWales. Yvonne is from the Gold Coast. She tells us that she's just turned 80 and is travelling around the country by herself in a caravan. Huh? What is it with these not so young women and solo travelling through the remote outback. We thought that Jane from a couple of days ago was crazy enough, but this lady's twenty years older. Haven\u2019t any of these people seen \u201cWolf Creek\u201d? (For the uninitiated this was a movie based loosely on the true story of British backpackers Joanne Lees and Peter Falconio. They were attacked in their campervan in central Australia in 2001, and Falconio was dragged away never to be seen again.) Issy asks Yvonne if her children worry about her, but she says they\u2019re mostly just jealous.\n\nWe got an email from the tour company yesterday asking us how much we weigh. The fine print said that if we were out by more than 15% they reserved the right to kick us off the flight. We haven't weighed ourselves since we left home, so I gave them our weights from then. We do however seem to have been consuming an awful lot of food while we\u2019ve been away, \n\nso hopefully they'll let us board. They seem very trusting; they don't weigh us again before climb into our seats. I hope the plane doesn't fall out of the sky.\n\nOur pilot Matt flies us up over the heavily irrigated Ord River valley and then on over Lake Argyle. He tells us that the dam wall was raised recently and the lake's capacity is now more than twenty times that of Sydney Harbour. Perhaps unsurprisingly it\u2019s now the country\u2019s largest freshwater body. The site of the original Durack property (of \u201cKings in Grass Castles\u201d fame) is under the lake somewhere, and the buildings themselves were relocated before the dam was built. The Duracks took a couple of years to get here overland from Queensland, arriving in 1882, and were the first to establish a pastoral operation in this neck of the woods.\n\nWe pass over the Argyle diamond mine which we're told only ceased operations last year. It sounds like there was a bit of subterfuge at play in the lead up to its opening. Someone was apparently commissioned to investigate whether there was anything out here worth digging up. The list of things they were asked to \n\nlook for was apparently very specific, and included all the usual suspects - iron ore, copper, zinc, uranium, etc. Diamonds weren\u2019t on the list, so when they found them they didn't feel obliged to tell anyone. They then proceeded to take out a lease themselves, and spent the next several years digging up their fortune. ....well something like that.\n\nWe approach the spectacular Bungle Bungle Range - hundreds of characteristic bee-hive shaped rock formations criss-crossed by spectacular deep gorges. It seems that the Bungle Bungles have only been discovered by the outside world relatively recently. The local indigenous folk had been living here for the best part of 20,000 years. They weren't however overly keen on letting others in on the secret, only to then have thousands of tourists tramp all over their iconic landscape. This all changed in 1982 when the area appeared on a documentary about the Kimberley, and the whole world suddenly wanted a piece of the action.\n\nWe land and meet our indigenous guide, Bec. We start our hike through the bee-hives to the mind blowingly spectacular Cathedral Gorge - a virtually completely enclosed amphitheatre surrounded by sheer overhanging red cliffs. The acoustics seem \n\npretty good. Bec tells us that a symphony orchestra once played in here; they lowered the piano in by helicopter. She gives us a mini-concert of her own - hauntingly beautiful singing accompanied by beating sticks.\n\nBec's a mine of stories. We ask her how she learnt English. She says the convent nuns beat it into her with a stick across the knuckles. One of her fingers is permanently deformed as a result. Her grandmother was apparently a bit less than impressed with this treatment, and took to the nun in question with a stick of her own. Go granny! What was it with these sadistic sisters - how could they possibly have missed the main part of their Lord's message by such a long way..... Bec tells us that she didn\u2019t believe that the nuns were really white skinned - she thought they just put a lot of powder on their faces. One of her worst alleged \u201ccrimes\u201d was having the temerity to occasionally speak in her own language.\n\nBec tells the story of being charged with the responsibility of escorting some of the local elders to Perth for an art exhibition. They\u2018d never really seen too \n\nmuch of western civilisation before, and apparently took a while to adjust. Bec tried to get one of the elders into the lift at the hotel they were staying at, but he wasn\u2019t having a bar of it. He told her he didn\u2019t want a sex change. He said he stood in front of the lift and watched on as the doors opened and a man went in, but the next time they opened the person who came out was a woman. If that wasn\u2019t enough trauma she thought she\u2019d try taking them to the zoo. Their reaction to the elephants was that they looked like pretty funny looking bulls with their horns in the wrong places.\n\nWe deposit our gear in our glamping tent at the local wilderness lodge, and Bec then drives us out into the scrub to watch the sunset, accompanied by drinks and a cheese platter. The silence is deafening and the peace is palpable. It\u2019s hard to imagine the day improving from here, but it does in the form of a gourmet three course meal back at the lodge. There are only nine people staying here tonight. I wander away from the camp into \n\nthe pitch darkness to try to take some happy snaps of the Milky Way. I think I may have inadvertently set my tripod up in the middle of a road but it\u2019s too dark to be sure, well it was until Bec tried to reverse her car out and nearly ran me over\u2026.",
    "Dear All\n\nGreetings and a Merry Christmas! I am writing this entry after my first venture off the island of Great Britain in nearly two years! Yay \u2013 how wonderful, and I feel truly blessed to have been able to do this. Whilst Great Britain is certainly a beautiful island, and I have very much enjoyed exploring more of it these last two years due to the circumstances, it is still an island, and for a travelling soul like myself, I haven\u2019t felt completely myself being island-bound for so long. The great wide world out there has been beckoning, and I feel more confident in being able to explore it again.\n\nAlas, I did not venture far this time \u2013 just a short hop over to the nearby Isle of Man, but it was certainly a step in the right direction. I decided after I came back from Scotland in the summer that I was ready to travel abroad again, and jump through any hoops which they put out there, in order to get my travelling life back again. I booked this trip a couple of months ago, along with a trip to Ireland in February, and New England \nThe TriskelionThe Triskelion\nThe Triskelion\n\"Quocunque Jeceris Stabit\", \"Whithersoever you throw it, it will stand\". The Three Legs of Man symbol of the Isle of Man.\nUSA in April, and feel ready for this gentle increase in venturing abroad again. I will of course play it by ear for my next two trips and see how it goes, with the option of cancelling if need be. Nevertheless, as mentioned, I feel ready to jump through those hoops, fill in the forms, take the tests, and do what is needed, just to feel myself again. Thank you in particular to Merry Jo and Dave, Brendan V, and Lori and Susan, my fellow TB-buddies on here, whose recent excursions abroad have encouraged me to have the confidence to do the same.\n\nSo yes \u2013 the Isle of Man! Before the world changed, I was actually planning to do this trip this time last year, December 2020. It was a follow-on from my December 2019 trip to Guernsey and Sark, and December 2018 visit to the island of Jersey. These three distant islands of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man all appear as three separate territories on the Travellers\u2019 Century Club\u2019s list, so along with being low-hanging fruit to add up my TCC list of countries, I was also intrigued to explore these distant little neighbours. While \nSeagullSeagull\nSeagull\nDouglas, Isle of Man\nJersey and Guernsey are both really quite tiny, at 45 and 25 square miles respectively, the Isle of Man is comparatively huge, at 221 square miles. They all have similar populations, 60,000 for Guernsey, 100,000 for Jersey, and 85,000 for the Isle of Man. But with their sizes, the Isle of Man is much less densely populated, and felt much less claustrophobic, with vast open spaces, long and empty roads, rolling hills, and swathes of deserted beaches and coastlines. It was really very beautiful, and felt like a large chunk of Yorkshire had simply been plucked up and plonked in the middle of the Irish Sea. The country also has an intriguing past to learn about, having developed out of both Celtic and Norse Viking origins, and is surprisingly abundant in myths, magic and fairy tales. It was a very special place, and a good place to name my 99th TCC country. All being well, Ireland in February will mark my 100th TCC country, and enable me to gain fully-fledged (as opposed to merely provisional) membership status!\n\nHaving just finished for the Christmas holidays, I took an EasyJet flight from London Gatwick airport on a Sunday evening. It was \nPeel CastlePeel Castle\nPeel Castle\nPeel\ngood to see there were many people in the airport, even if only one of its two terminals was operating. The gentleman who served me in the Wetherspoons pub there said it was the busiest it had been since March 2020. It was pleasing to see so many people travelling, visiting relatives, and getting over the many obstacles the government has placed for us under these trying circumstances. I must admit I felt a bit nervous flying again after so long. My least favourite parts of flying are taking-off and landing, and since this was simply an up-and-down flight, the whole flight was an uncomfortable one for me. I remember feeling the same flying to Jersey and Guernsey. I guess on a long-haul flight, once you are up there and cruising one can switch off easily from the fact that one is ten kilometres up in the air. Not so when just going up and coming down. We were also landing in 50mph gales, but it was surprisingly smooth coming down \u2013 what a relief!\n\nThe airport was fairly easy to pass through, once the prior formalities had been met \u2013 I had to apply for a vaccination exemption \nMy Travel Guide for the Isle of ManMy Travel Guide for the Isle of Man\nMy Travel Guide for the Isle of Man\nThere is no Lonely Planet coverage of the island, this was a good and informative book.\nform and a \u201cManx Entry Permit\u201d online a few weeks before my visit, having demonstrated that I had been fully vaccinated. I then had to complete a landing form within 48 hours prior to my arrival, and commit to taking a self-administered Lateral Flow Test within 12 hours after arrival, submitting my result online to the Isle of Man government. This was comparatively simple compared to the PCR tests that have to be booked for other places, currently for both going out and coming back, and thus I felt I had chosen well to have the Isle of Man as my first trip abroad under the current situation. I must admit I felt fear at the prospect of potentially having to self-isolate on the island for ten days should my test turn out positive, but as the course of my trip taught me, it is important to choose faith not fear in these times. I felt I was able to conquer a number of fears during my days on the Isle of Man.\n\nOnce through security having demonstrated evidence of all the above, I took a taxi to take me to my accommodation for my four-nights on the island. \nThe AnnexThe Annex\nThe Annex\nMy accommodation, Lower Foxdale, Isle of Man\nThe taxi seriously speeded through the Manx countryside along the dark country lanes. The Isle of Man quite famously has no speed limit outside urban areas, and I clocked the driver going at a steady 70mph through the dark country lanes - a bit unusual, and a little hairy I must admit! We got to my accommodation safely though, and rather quickly (!), and I certainly chose well! I had booked myself into a delightful Air BnB property, an annex adjoining the detached cottage of a truly wonderful Christian couple, husband from Birmingham and wife from Kenya, who had settled on the island around three years ago. The cottage was in a tiny village called Lower Foxdale, along a lush and isolated valley following the Foxdale River at the foot of the highest mountain in the south of the Isle, South Barrule, home apparently to the island\u2019s Celtic god and protector, Manannan \u2013 more on him later. The annex had a bedroom, bathroom, lounge/dining room, and kitchen, with all amenities imaginable, and the couple were there to welcome me and settle me in. I took the Lateral Flow Test with a negative result, and settled myself down into my first \n\nAt the foot of South Barrule Mountain in the distance, home to the island's protector, Celtic sea god Manannan\nevening on the Isle of Man, TCC country number 99!\n\nMy first sleep was a bit troubled, as it often is on the first night of a trip, but also aiming to conquer a few of the fears of being abroad during such circumstances. I awoke refreshed though, and really excited to be exploring a completely new land again. This first day was just wonderful, and there were several moments when I felt completely in my happy place again for pretty much the first time in two years, exploring new places and meeting new people in an unknown land. It was bliss, I was in my natural state and habitat once again. There was a bus stop just outside my accommodation, but the bus runs along that route only once every two hours or so, so I found it more convenient to walk 30 minutes up the road to the village of St Johns, where there were bus connections running to the island\u2019s capital Douglas every 20 minutes. I didn\u2019t know it when I booked my accommodation, but St Johns is of utmost historical and political importance to the Isle of Man, and my visit there helped me to understand more about the foundations and politics of this unusual little country.\n\nManx people, as residents of the island are officially known, trace their origins back to the Celtic period, when the Celts were abundant throughout the British Isles during the neolithic period. The Romans overlooked the Isle of Man in their conquest of Britain in the first century AD. Along with Scotland and Ireland, the island\u2019s Celtic culture thus continued until the arrival of the Norse Vikings, who starting raiding and then settling the island during the 8th to 9th centuries. By 1154, the island had been incorporated into the Norse territory called the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, comprising the Scottish Hebrides islands and the Isle of Man. It then became a part of Scotland for a short period in the 13th to 14th centuries. Since 1399 however, England, and latterly the United Kingdom, have claimed some kind of leadership over the island and its people, yet despite this, it has always retained its own self-governance and independence. It is today regarded as a British Crown Dependency, looking to the Queen as its sovereign, but holding its own independent government. The country\u2019s parliament, called Tynwald, is actually the oldest continuous parliament in the world, ruling over the island for over 1000 years. Instead of Members of Parliament (or MPs), Tynwald\u2019s parliament is formed of 24 Members of the House of Keys (or MHKs), each representing the various parishes of the country. The tiny village of St Johns is a very important place in the country, as the Manx Parliament continues to meet there, as they have done for centuries, once a year on 5th July, also known as midsummer\u2019s day or Tynwald Day, to pass and approve new laws which have been proposed over the previous year. The MHKs, the island\u2019s Lieutenant Governor, and the Lord of Mann, often represented by a member of the British Royal Family, meet and sit on Tynwald Hill, in the heart of St Johns, an artificial hill said to have been built from the soil of all of the island\u2019s parishes centuries ago.\n\nAfter grabbing a coffee at a nearby friendly caf\u00e9, I headed up Tynwald Hill, through the nearby Tynwald National Park, and on to the Royal Chapel of St John the Baptist, where Tynwald Day is also marked with a special service. It was a lovely introduction to the country, to visit its political heart. I then took a bus eastwards, to my next destination for the day, the country\u2019s capital, Douglas.\n\nI loved Douglas as soon as I arrived. With a population of only 27,000, it is still the island\u2019s main population hub, and is not yet even a city. This may change this coming year, however, as along with Peel on the opposite side of the island, Douglas has applied to the UK government for city-status \u2013 something which British settlements can do apparently each time there is a Queen\u2019s Jubilee. 2022 will mark the platinum (70 years!!) jubilee of the Queen on the throne, and both Douglas and Peel are taking advantage of the event to apply for city status. I got off the bus at the town\u2019s Sea Terminal, and enjoyed a wonderful walk along the promenade, taking in the majestic two-mile sweep of a bay, with the iconic Tower of Refuge jutting out of St Mary's Isle in the middle of it. This Tower was built in 1832 to provide shelter for the many mariners who became shipwrecked on the tiny island as they were arriving in or leaving the town\u2019s harbour. Today it is the town\u2019s emblem, and provides a really attractive seascape overlooked by the lovely row of elegant Victorian hotels lining the prom. My walk took me past the very recently-erected statue of the Bee Gees (July 2021), Isle of Man natives who went on to worldwide fame from their humble beginnings in Douglas, past the famous Gaiety Theatre and then heading inland again to the wonderful Manx Museum. After a lovely lunch at a nearby caf\u00e9, smoked salmon, tomato and onion bagel with carrot and coriander soup, I spent a blissful hour or two in this fact-packed museum, learning about the island\u2019s prehistory, Celtic and Norse origins, and more recent jollities such as the Victorian and post-war tourist booms when the island became a hotspot for vacationing northern Englanders, and the world-famous TT (Tourist Trophy) races which began in 1907 and should re-start again this coming year after a two-year c-word-related hiatus. In actual fact, my grandparents met while they were both holidaying on the island not long after World War Two. My Grandad was there on a golfing holiday, and my Granny was there to watch the TT races. I recall my Granny saying Grandad came up to her and spoke to her while she was having dinner somewhere, and then they apparently met the next day to take in a round of golf. Shortly after along came four children, nine grandchildren (including myself), and four great-grandchildren. It felt really quite special to visit the place where they had met, and where the Waring family as I know it really began.\n\nAfter the Manx Museum, I headed back to the bus station near the Sea Terminal again, taking in along the way the government buildings and the Tynwald Court where MHKs meet on the third Tuesday of each month to discuss matters of state. I took another bus back towards St Johns again, and then further along to the west coast town of Peel, the other town seeking city-status in 2022. I arrived in Peel around 3.30pm, with the town\u2019s main attraction the House of Manannan closing within an hour. The bus dropped me right at the front door fortunately, and along with the Manx Museum back in Douglas, I was again the only visitor during my time there. I do love visiting tourist places out of the tourist-season, and this was certainly no exception. \n\nThe downsider was that aside from these two excellent museums, all other tourist attractions on the island were closed during my visit, including the famed Manx Electric Railway, the Steam Railway, Snaefell Mountain Railway, and the Douglas Horse Trams.\n\nAh well, the House of Manannan was just amazing!! Whilst the Manx Museum seemed to focus mainly on history and modern culture, the House of Manannan seemed much more focused on the island\u2019s Celtic roots and culture. It is named after the afore-mentioned Celtic god of the sea, Manannan, whose legendary home is the Isle of Man. I can just imagine the heart of the ancient Celtic world, being based in both Great Britain and Ireland, seeing the distant shape of the Isle of Man in the middle of the Irish Sea separating the two large islands, and imagining it being the home of the great sea god himself. Manannan apparently kept the island safe from invaders, such as the Romans, by having the amazing ability to be able to cloak the island in cloud and fog when potential invaders drew near. His dwelling place is the afore-mentioned South Barrule mountain, looming over the village of Lower Foxdale where I \nGreens CafeGreens Cafe\nwas staying, and here in the House of Manannan, Manannan himself is your host guiding you through the various exhibits from the past to the present. I found this very cleverly done, as whatever time period you were in, the same actor portraying Manannan appeared on the various TV screens donning the typical fashions of the day. In Celtic times he was dressed in a cloak, in Victorian times he was dressed as a sea captain. I loved the presentation of the island in the museum as a magical, mystical land of legend and beauty. I enjoyed my visit immensely, even though I was fairly rushing through it to see everything before they ushered me out very promptly at 4.30pm closing time.\n\nBy this time, the sun was setting, and the harbour of Peel was beautifully lit with the gorgeous Peel Castle on St Patrick\u2019s Isle taking pride of place in the distance. I took some incredible photos of the sunset from Peel, looking west over the Irish Sea and giving extraordinary lights from reds, to oranges, to blues even, over the Mountains of Mourne in Northern Ireland across the distant waters. Peel Castle was another of the closed \n\n\nattractions during my visit, but it was enough to see it from the outside. I had the option to walk around it, but with the darkness drawing in, and stories of the castle being haunted by a giant black dog, I opted against this, instead taking a lovely stroll along the cute little beach in front of the main town itself. I then stopped by the local Co-Op to stock up on all my self-catering supplies for the remainder of my time on the island, and timed it perfectly for a return bus to Lower Foxdale leaving at 6.07pm which would go down the Foxdale River Valley this time and drop me right outside my accommodation.\n\nWith a stocked-up fridge, and my cosy accommodation welcoming me with open arms, I felt amazingly at peace after such an enjoyable first day on the real travelling road again. I was very much in my happy place again beyond the fears of the night before, had many memories of the day to contemplate, and slept absolutely wonderfully for a whole ten hours that night. It was a wonderful start to my time on the island.\n\nI shall write about day two of my Isle of Man adventures in my next one, so for now, thank you for reading, and all the best to all \ud83d\ude0a",
    "I'm not sure what drew me in and made me want to read A Flicker of Light by Katie Powner, an author whose writing is new to me.  Perhaps it was the scenic and beautiful setting of a small town in the mountains of Montana.  Maybe it was the relationships of this family who had been through some difficult years.  What is the secret that Grandma June has kept all of these years? \n \n\nBea is 21 years old, and she and her husband, Jeremy, are expecting their first child.  Their circumstances have changed, and she\u2019s going to reach out to her father to see if they can stay with him for a few months while they get a handle on things.  Mitch Jenson has been alone now for two years, following the death of his wife, Caroline.  He couldn\u2019t imagine his life without her, and there\u2019s not a day that goes by that he doesn\u2019t desperately miss her.  His parents, Randall and Juniper Jenson, health is not the best.  Now Mitch needs to figure out how he can help them navigate this new season of life.\n\n \n\nA Flicker of Light is about relationships with family and friends.  It\u2019s about pain and vulnerability and needing help but wanting to be independent.  I loved the town of Moose Creek and the beauty of Montana.  I could relate to Mitch as he had to deal with his mother facing dementia and tried to figure out how he could help his parents.  I was curious about June and her secret.  How would she respond when the truth came out? \n\n \n\nI\u2019m so glad that I discovered A Flicker of Light and look forward to reading more books from Katie Powner.  The characters in this book were very relatable, likable, and I cared about them.  Good decent people that you would like to know. There was a little mystery, and I appreciated seeing the characters grow and change.  I took my time reading this book, and it was lovely to end the day spending time with these characters.  I appreciated that this book is clean, with no profanity, and faith was a part of the story. \n\n \n\nI would like to thank Bethany House Publishers and NetGalley for the opportunity to read a complimentary copy of A Flicker of Light by Katie Powner.

    "I am grateful to have rediscovered Tracie Peterson\u2019s writing and her recent book Waiting on Love which is part of the Ladies of the Lake series.  This book is very different from what I usually read, but it was the storyline and characters which drew me in.  \n\n \n\nElise Wright is very different than her sister Caroline.  Both girls grew up sailing the sea with their father Captain Bill Wright and mother Mary, on their ship the Mary Elise.  Caroline has chosen to marry a wealthy high society man she met through her aunt and uncle.  But Elise loves the life she has on the sea.  She will fulfill the promise she made to her dying mother, to continue to take care of her father and the ship\u2019s crew.  The ship will be taking on two new sailors, Nick Clark, a man who is haunted by his past, and Booker Duran a man who is on the run.  Captain Wright sees something in both men and he wants to give them a second chance.\n\n \n\nI absolutely loved this book!  I read a lot of books by Christian authors and publishers and most of them have very little about faith.  Not so with Waiting on Love by Tracie Peterson.  The Christian faith and the Gospel of Jesus Christ are front and center in the lives of the characters and how they live, what they say and do.  The Gospel and Bible verses are shared as part of the storyline and development of the characters.  I appreciated and enjoyed the honesty and integrity of the characters, their graciousness, mercy, and kindness. \n\n \n\nOf course, there is always an antagonist or two in stories.  I appreciated the integrity and upright character displayed by the main characters in how they dealt with deceitful people seeking to do harm to others.\n\n \n\nReading Waiting on Love by Tracie Peterson left me with good examples of Christians living out their faith in an interesting story that takes place in the 1800s.  I am so happy to have rediscovered Tracie Peterson.  Reading this book makes me want to go back and read her earlier novels.  I would like to commend Bethany House Publishers for allowing the Christian faith and the Gospel message to be shared in this fictional story. \n\n \n\nI highly recommend Waiting on Love by Tracie Peterson.  An interesting story, which takes place in a different era and a unique setting.  I appreciated the refreshing honesty and integrity of the characters and examples of godly living.  I liked that Elise embraced her femininity, and the men their masculinity.  That\u2019s not something you see too much these days in fiction. \n\n \n\nI would like to thank Bethany House Publishers and NetGalley for the opportunity to read a complimentary copy of Waiting on Love by Tracie Peterson.

    "Labyrinth of Lies by Irene Hannon is the second book in the Triple Threat series.  In this newest book, readers are introduced to Cate Reilly, sister to Eve Reilly featured in the first book of the series Point of Danger. \n \n\nCate is a detective in St. Louis County, and she\u2019s the right person for an undercover assignment.  Teenagers Stephanie Laurent and Alex Johnson have been missing for two months.  New evidence indicates they are not runaways but victims of foul play.  Cate agrees to go undercover at Ivy Hill Academy to try and find out what happened to the missing teens.  It\u2019s been eight years since she\u2019d last seen Zeke Sloan, the man she loved who walked out on her for his career as a DEA agent.  As it turns out, Zeke is also working undercover at the school as a Spanish teacher.  Cate\u2019s undercover assignment just got a lot more complicated. \n\n \n\nIrene did a great job in building the suspense and mystery.  It was at times unnerving, especially for the characters whose lives were being impacted by the subterfuge around them.  I really liked the characters, especially Kayla, Edwardo Garcia, and his wife Margarita.  As the story unfolds, readers learn how characters got caught up in the evils of drug trafficking.  Because some of the characters go by anonymous names, like Razor and Wolf, you don\u2019t know who the bad guys are.  It was interesting reading about how people justify getting involved in evil.  I liked the friendship that developed between Cate and Kayla.  I didn\u2019t know how Edwardo would be able to get out of the impossible situation he was in.  I also liked how Cate and Zeke worked through their relationship.\n\n \n\nI wish the character\u2019s Christian faith had been developed in this storyline.  I think the book would have been richer with that element.  I wasn't too keen on the feminist aspect of Cate and her sisters and the focus on the physical attraction between Cater and Zeke in a Christian fiction book.  \n\n \n\nIf you like mystery and suspense, give Labyrinth of Lies by Irene Hannon a read.  I liked this second book better than the first one in the series because of some of the characters. \n\n \n\nI would like to thank Revell Publishers and NetGalley for the opportunity to read a complimentary copy of Labyrinth of Lies by Irene Hannon.

    "  Let's go on the record. We are in chambers, and this is \nthe matter of Kitzmiller, of course, versus Dover Area School \nDistrict. We have assembled as planned with respect to the issue of \ncertain subpoenas that have been issued to reporters Joseph Maldonado \nand Heidi Bernhard-Bubb.\n\nPresent in chambers are counsel for both the plaintiffs and the \ndefendants, and in addition to that, let me ask that you enter your \nappearances specially, presumably as counsel for the individuals we \nreferred to in our orders collectively as \"reporters.\"\n\n\n\n    I'm here, Niles Benn, on behalf of both of the reporters, \nHeidi Bernard-Bubb and Joseph Maldonado. And with me is Terance Barna,\nan attorney in my office, as well.\n\n\n\n    All right. Now, previously, on September 12th, the Court \nentered an order which went to the motion for reconsideration. That \nrelated specifically to -- filed by the reporters. That went \nspecifically to our August 2nd order which, in effect, said that the \nreporters would have to testify at certain depositions. Subsequently, \nthe reporters were, if memory serves, approximately eight days ago, \nsubpoenaed to testify by the plaintiffs in the case-in-chief. Yet \nanother motion to quash or for alternative relief was filed by the \nreporters through Mr. Benn's office. By our order of last Thursday \n-- the date escapes me, I think it was Thursday -- the Court denied \nrelief in that matter. The Court was advised that yesterday, on \nSeptember the 27th, the reporters, both of them, showed up at the \nappointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the\ndefendants, and I'm advised -- and I'll correct this if I'm wrong \n-- that both reporters cited the reporter's privilege that they consider\nto exist under the First Amendment so that they would not answer \nany questions at those depositions. We're brought here today by that, \nas well as the fact that I presume you're here because the reporters\nhave been properly subpoenaed to appear in the plaintiffs' \ncase-in-chief. Now, have I mischaracterized anything from your \nstandpoint? \n\n\n\n    No, everything that you said is correct, Your \nHonor. \n\n\n\n    Now, the most salient question then is, with \nrespect to the reporters' appearance today, is it your understanding \nthat the reporters are intending to invoke the same privilege cited \nby them yesterday, if called, when called, to testify by the \nplaintiffs?\n\n\n\n    Yes.\n\n\n\n    All right.\n\n\n\n    But that's the reason why I had asked if we could have \nthis conference.\n\n\n\n    The floor is yours.\n\n\n\n    Thanks. I'm not here to discuss law. I think we have \ndiscussed the law ad nauseam with respect to briefs, argument. I \ncertainly understand the opinion and orders that have been rendered by\nthe Court, and I appreciate them.\n\nAnd I don't want there to be a misunderstanding in terms as to this\ncase being wrongly focused. And what I mean by that, with regard to\nall of you in this room is that we've got approximately 40 people from\nthe media that are observing this trial in the courtroom, plus \noutside of the courtroom.\n\nIn speaking for myself, it would be my humble opinion that if these \nparties were called to the stand to testify and refuse to testify, \nas I just indicated to you, Your Honor, that I think the focus of \nthis trial all of the sudden isn't addressed as to intelligent \ndesign, but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in \nterms as to these stringers, not full-time employees, not employees at\nall, standing up for what they think is right. And I really truly \nbelieve in my heart of hearts the focus gets misdirected. I really \ntruly do mean that, because I don't think that should be the focus \nof this case.\n\nAs a result of that, Mr. Barna and I have spent days in an effort \nto try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow \nameliorate the problem so that, in a certain sense, everybody gets \nwhat they want. I clearly will not get what I want, because at the \nend of the day, if I agree that my reporters are going to testify \npredicated upon something that I want to propose here, that's more \nthan I would want, because I stand by the fact and they stand by \nthe fact that there's a reporter's privilege here.\n\nThey refuse to testify at a deposition, and my suggestion to them \nwas that if we were capable of resolving something as a result of \nthis conference, that they would then attend a deposition, because I \nbelieve the defendants would have a right to cross-examine them or \notherwise examine them prior to them taking the stand. And based upon\nthat, they would then testify in court.\n\nBut we have several issues. One is that when we filed our motion to\nquash last week, quite honestly, we thought we did it in a timely \nfashion because we filed it only after we were served with the \nsubpoena. Your Honor summarily dismissed that motion to quash, so, in \neffect, if my reporters were to be called upon to testify today by \nthe plaintiffs, they're undressed. They've got no protective order at \nall. They're just regular people. Because the order I believe that \nyou had previously entered related to the deposition and not related \nto their appearance in court. So that raises an issue for us because\nclearly we would otherwise object to them taking the stand under the\norder as it currently exists or the motion that you're -- your \nposition that the motion to quash could not stand.\n\nI interpret the order and the amended order to mean that Your Honor,\nin a sense, has addressed them as fact witnesses. I don't think you\nactually come out and use the word \"fact witnesses,\" but as one \nreads the order, that's the implication. And you initially had \nindicated that you did not feel that the reporter's privilege stood \nin this kind of a case.\n\nThese two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings\nin terms of different municipalities and school districts. And \nironically -- in a sense, I have to commend both Mr. Maldonado and \nMs. Bernard-Bubb because, again, they're paid per story. They get \nanywhere between $40 and $50 a story. They might make $300, $400 a \nweek if they write X number of stories, and that's it. And the \nstories that they write predominantly are municipal stories.\n\nShe's a full-time mom. She's breastfeeding. She has a seven-month old \nchild, and so she works at night when her husband is at home. He's \na schoolteacher. Mr. Maldonado owns a little deli in the market in \nYork, and he home-schools his son, his youngest son who has learning \ndisabilities. And he's been doing that for the last three years. So \nthis is just supplemental income to them because they're not very \nwealthy people. But yet without a lot of education in terms of \njournalism, they believe that what they're standing for is the right \nthing.\n\nI don't have control over them as I would an employee of the Daily \nRecord or the Dispatch because they are stringers and independent. So \nhaving said that, their fear is that because of all those \nmunicipalities that they cover and the school districts that they \ncover, that at least in the Middle District Court, should a matter \ncome up similar to this case, then they are exposed as a fact \nwitness.\n\nI've related to them, quite frankly, this is the first case we've \never had in federal court in the years that I've been doing \nnewspaper law, and most of our cases are in county courts, and so, \nyou know, there's a different issue there. But having said that, the \nconcern that I have is that there is a precedent being set in the \ncounties that these people otherwise work.\n\nSo how do I make it better? Well, we provided an affidavit, and \nthat affidavit indicated that we, if called upon to testify, would \nvalidate the authenticity of the articles that were written. We did \nthat, in effect, to offer to both sides so that we wouldn't \notherwise have to testify. Accepted by the plaintiffs, not accepted by\nthe defendants. Defendants wanted to have the right of \ncross-examination.\n\nAnd at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the \nwords \"perceived, saw, and heard,\" we were concerned, as you well \nknow, with the word \"perceived\" in terms as to what's the thought \nprocess. And there was dialogue on the phone amongst all of us, and \nyou made it very clear that you did not want any testimony that \nwould otherwise relate to biases and prejudices. And, in fact, when \nyou reviewed the notes of the reporters, you had also indicated that \nyour review of Heidi Bubb's notes and the e-mails clearly evidence \nthat there was no bias in the writings, those writings.\n\nThe concern that we currently have is that the order reads, in \neffect, that they have to testify as fact witnesses, predicated upon \nmy interpretation, as to what is otherwise unpublished material so \nthat, for example -- just using this for example.\n\n\n\n    That's not my intention.\n\n\n\n    No, no, but I --\n\n\n\n    Well, that's not my intention. And I wanted to let you \ngo as far as you could, and I think I have to interject and I \nwant to interject and I want to be clear, because I think it's \nimportant that I do that. Let me address a couple points that you \nmade.\n\nFirst of all, I understand and deeply respect the position that \nyou're in in this case. And by saying that the motion was untimely, \nit was not legally untimely, it was untimely in my view only in the\nsense that it came, as I said, on the eve of trial, when we knew \nthat there was going to be an issue with respect to their testimony \nat trial. It was an attempt to bring this to a head. It was \nsuccessful in that respect. It was not successful in solving the \nproblem, but it was successful to bringing it to a head. So to that\nextent, I succeeded, good, bad, or indifferent.\n\nWith respect to the point that you made as it relates to their \ntestimony at trial, that is a very valid point. However, I will tell\nyou that the sense of my opinion as it related to their deposition \ntestimony and as reconsidered and as honed in the reconsideration, was\nthat it was meant to apply -- the general thrust of that, the \nprotections, if you will, in that opinion were meant to apply in the\nsame sense to their testimony at trial, if they chose to testify, \nand they would be protected in every way by the Court, and they \nwould not be questioned in the broader sense. So it would not revert\nback to an unprotected realm, if you will, at the time of trial.\n\nTo be as clear as I can be, at issue in this case -- and I can't \nparticularly be concerned about precedential value. I understand your \nconcern in that regard. I have to try this case the best way that \nI know how. The concern in this case, and it is a vital concern by\nall parties, is that we have, as you well know, to restate the \nobvious, we have newspaper articles within which there are quotes from\nindividuals. Those quotes go, at least in one sense, to the purpose \nbehind the policy that was enacted by the Dover School Board.\n\nThe simple issue here, because it is the Court's understanding that \nthese individuals have denied that they made these remarks, is from \nthe plaintiffs' standpoint how can they get something that is, in my \nview, on the purpose test, which clearly goes to the truth of the \nmatter asserted, how do they get these newspaper articles into \nevidence? Well, they can't, in my view, without the reporters \ntestifying.\n\nThe defendants might say that even with the reporters testifying, they\ncan't get them in. I think that's their argument. But at the very \nleast, in my view, and I think the plaintiffs might agree with this,\nthe reporters would have to testify.\n\nI didn't say this strictly in the opinion, perhaps, but my opinion \nwas not meant to allow the testimony of the reporters to go in any \nway, in particular, outside the four corners of the affidavits \nrendered by the reporters. I can't say that to the word, and that's \nwhy the opinions were crafted the way that they were. The Court has \nto have some discretion on the questioning.\n\nBut I was as clear as I could possibly be that what is at issue \nhere would be, for example, the particular events that the reporters \nwrote about and questions such as -- simple questions, did they attend \nthe meeting, did they hear them say the comments, did they write the\nstory immediately after, did they take notes at the time of the \nmeeting.\n\nI thought my opinion was clear in that regard, and as you \nappropriately characterize, no questions as to bias or motivation or \nreasons to misrepresent quotes would be allowed in. There I believe \nwe would decidedly fly in the face of established case law.",
    "Let's welcome the candidates, Governor Bush and Vice President Gore. Good evening, from Wake Chapel at Wake Forest University at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I'm Jim Lehrer of the News Hour on PBS. Welcome to this second election 2000 debate between the Republican candidate for president, George W. Bush of Texas, and the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore. These debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns. Only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine. The format tonight is that of a conversation. The only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever, ever exceed two minutes. The prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always, absolute quiet, please. Good evening, Governor Bush, Vice President Gore. The end of our 90 minutes last week in Boston, the total time each of you took was virtually the same. Let's see if we can do the same tonight, or come close. Governor Bush, the first question goes to you. One of you is about to be elected the leader of the single-most powerful nation in the world, economically, financially, militarily, diplomatically, you name it. Have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power?\n I have, I have. First question is what's in the best interests of the United States? What's in the best interests of our people? When it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question. Is it in our nation's interests? Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests. Having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nation's interests. Strong relations in Europe is in our nation's interest. I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president. I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy. I haven't started naming names except for one person, and that's Mr. Richard Cheney who I thought did a great job the other night. He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him. He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side. One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people. I've been able to set clear goals. The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals. That's what a Chief Executive Officer does. So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.\n Vice President Gore?\n Yes, Jim. I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world. I see it as a question of values. It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be. And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans. It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us. As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom. So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union. The power of example is America's greatest power in the world. And that means, for example, standing up for human rights. It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential. So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws. We've got to deal with things like racial profiling. And we have to keep our military strong. We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way. But our real power comes, I think, from our values.\n Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world? How would you project us around the world, as president?\n Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed. I don't think they'll look at us with envy. It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy. If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us. If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us. And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble. And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom. So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are. We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.\n A humble nation.\n I agree with that. I agree with that. I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway. That there is some resentment of U.S. power. So I think that the idea of humility is an important one. But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world. We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about. That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong. You know, in the last, or two decades ago it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time. The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough. We need to do more. But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.\n Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?\n Yes, it does. Take, for example, Third World debt. I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions. I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes. We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people. We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world. We can lend money but we have to do it wisely. We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials. So we have to be guarded in our generosity.\n Let's go through some of the specifics now. New question. Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East. Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have. What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?\n The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there. We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured. We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on. I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there. The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now. It's a very tense situation there. But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there. It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue. Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there. And we just have to take it day-to-day right now. But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing. Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives. They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring. And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.\n Governor?\n Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions. Like the vice president, I call on Chairman Arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace. I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East. I want everybody to know should I be the president Israel's going to be our friend. I'm going to stand by Israel. Secondly, that I think it's important to reach out to moderate Arab nations, like Jordan and Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship. And that's going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in Israel, but with Saddam Hussein. The coalition against Saddam has fallen apart or it's unraveling, let's put it that way. The sanctions are being violated. We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction. He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president. But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resoluting your determination. One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the Saddam Husseins of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends. It's also important to keep strong ties in the Middle East, credible ties, because of the energy crisis we're now in. After all, a lot of the energy is produced from the Middle East, and so I appreciate what the administration is doing. I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.\n So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now? A lot of people pushing hey, the United States should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation.\n Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker. And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us. And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel.\n You agree with that, Governor?\n I do. I do think this, though. When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place. It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis. Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides. And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense. This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table. I will try to do the same thing. But it won't be on my timetable, it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the Middle East.\n People watching here tonight are very interested in Middle East policy, and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle Middle East policy. Is there any difference?\n I haven't heard a big difference in the last few exchanges.\n That's hard to tell. I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better.\n Saddam Hussein, you mean, get him out of there?\n I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well. We don't know -- there are no inspectors now in Iraq, the coalition that was in place isn't as strong as it used to be. He is a danger. We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East. And it's going to be hard, it's going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him.\n You feel that is a failure of the Clinton administration?\n I do.\n Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power. I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that that's the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that they're too weak to do it, but that's what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it. I don't think they should be allowed to.\n Did he state your position correctly, you're not calling for eliminating the sanctions, are you?\n No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher.\n Let's go on to Milosevic and Yugoslavia, and it falls under the area of our military power. Governor, new question. Should the fall of Milosevic be seen as a triumph for U.S. military intervention?\n I think it's a triumph. I thought the president made the right decision in joining NATO and bombing Serbia. I supported them when they did so. I called upon the Congress not to hamstring the administration, and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasn't necessarily in our best interest or fit our nation's strategy, and so I think it's good public policy, I think it worked, and I'm pleased I took -- made the decision I made. I'm pleased the president made the decision he made. Because freedom to go in that part of the world, and where there's a lot of work left to be done, however.\n But you think it would not have happened -- do you think that Milosevic would not have fallen if the United States and NATO had not intervened militarily? Is this a legitimate use of our military power?\n Yes, I think it is. Absolutely. I don't think he would have fallen had we not used the force. And I know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment. I supported the president. I thought he made the right decision to do so. I didn't think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively, but nevertheless, it worked. The administration deserves credit for having made it work. It is important for NATO to have it work. It's important for NATO to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in Europe. And one of the reasons I felt so strongly that the United States needed to participate was because of our relations with NATO, and NATO is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future. Now, there's more work to do. Remains to be seen, however, whether or not there's going to be a political settlement in Kosovo, and I certainly hope there is one. Also on record as saying at some point in time I hope our European friends become the peacekeepers in Bosnia and in the Balkans. I hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war.\n Well, I've been kind of a hard-liner on this issue for more than eight years. When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?\n Trying to figure out who the questioner was.\n If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops. I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took. I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident. I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President.\n Well, let's stay on the subject for a moment. New question related to this. I figured this out; in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of U.S. ground, air or naval forces. Let me name them. Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo. If you had been president for any of those interventions, would any of those interventions not have happened?\n Can you run through the list again?\n Sure. Lebanon.\n I thought that was a mistake.\n Grenada.\n I supported that.\n Panama.\n I supported that.\n Persian Gulf.\n Yes, I voted for it, supported it.\n Somalia.\n Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered. I did support it at the time. It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously.\n Bosnia.\n Oh, yes.\n Haiti.\n Yes.\n And then Kosovo.\n Yes.\n We talked about that. Want me to do it with you? Lebanon.\n Make a couple comments.\n Sure, absolutely, sure. Somalia.\n Started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nation-building mission, and that's where the mission went wrong. The mission was changed. And as a result, our nation paid a price. And so I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called nation-building. I think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war. I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests. But in this case it was a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. I wouldn't have supported either.\n What about Lebanon?\n Yes.\n Grenada.\n Yes.\n Panama?\n Yes. Some of them I've got a conflict of interest on, if you know what I mean.\n I do, I do. The Persian Gulf, obviously. And Bosnia. And you have already talked about Kosovo. But the reverse side of the question, Governor, that Vice President Gore mentioned, 600,000 people died in Rwanda in 1994. There was no U.S. intervention, no intervention from the outside world. Was that a mistake not to intervene?\n I think the administration did the right thing in that case. I do. It was a horrible situation, no one liked to see it on our TV screens, but it's a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in Rwanda. And that's a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in Africa come together and help deal with the situation. The administration, seem like we're having a great love for us tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda.\n Do you have any second thoughts on that, based on what you said a moment ago about genocide?\n I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first. Fine. We did, actually, send troops into Rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures. My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights. But I think in retrospect we were too late getting in there. We could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier. But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim. One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces. We tried everything else. If we have allies in the Balkans we have allies, NATO, ready, willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden. In Africa we did not. Now, we have tried -- our countries tried to create an Africa crisis response team there, and we've met some resistance. We have had some luck with Nigeria, but in Sierra Leon, and now that Nigeria has become a democracy, and we hope it stays that way, then maybe we can build on that. But because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there, I think it was the right thing not to jump in, as heartbreaking as it was, but I think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission.\n So what would you say, Governor, that somebody would say hey wait a minute, why not Africa, I mean why the Middle East, why the Balkans, but not Africa, when 600,000 people's lives are at risk?\n Well, I understand, and Africa is important. And we've got to do a lot of work in Africa to promote democracy and trade, and there are some -- Vice President mentioned Nigeria is a fledgling democracy. We have to work with Nigeria. That's an important continent. But there's got to be priorities, and Middle East is a priority for a lot of reasons, as is Europe and the Far East, our own hemisphere. And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity. I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide. I thought that was a good model. But we can't be all things to all people in the world, Jim. And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences. I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world. I want to be judicious in its use. You mentioned Haiti. I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti. I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile. It was a nation building mission, and it was not very successful. It cost us billions, a couple billions of dollars, and I'm not so sure democracy is any better off in Haiti than it was before.\n Vice President Gore, do you agree with the governor's views on nation building, the use of military, our military, for nation building as he described and defined it?\n I don't think we agree on that. I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas. I think we have to be very reticent about that. But look, Jim, the world is changing so rapidly. The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together. Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world. All these other countries are looking to us. Now, just because we cannot be involved everywhere, and shouldn't be, doesn't mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere. Now, both of us are kind of, I guess, stating the other's position in a maximalist extreme way, but I think there is a difference here. This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II. During the years between World War I and World War II, a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the United States. The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II. And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did. We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there. We still have lots of troops in Europe. And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's? We were nation building. And it was economic. But it was also military. And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there. We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.\n You said in the Boston debate, Governor, on this issue of nation building, that the United States military is overextended now. Where is it overextended? Where are there U.S. military that you would bring home if you become president?\n First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said. I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy. And we can't do that. We've got to rebuild our military. But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world. And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans. I would very much like to get our troops out of there. I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal. That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO. No one is suggesting that. But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground. And there is an example. Haiti is another example. Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia. I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world. The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia. But --\n The use of the military, there -- some people are now suggesting that if you don't want to use the military to maintain the peace, to do the civil thing, is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that? Is that on your radar screen?\n I don't think so. I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations. Maybe I'm missing something here. I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America? Absolutely not. Our military is meant to fight and win war. That's what it's meant to do. And when it gets overextended, morale drops. I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability. And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.\n I don't disagree with that. I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete. That's what we did in Haiti. There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now. And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy. That's really about all we can do. But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there. And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose. And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended. I certainly agree with that. And that's why I've supported building up our capacity. I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed. I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does. We've had some disagreements about that. He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say. But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength. And we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military.\n In the non-military area of influencing events around the world, the financial and economic are, the World Bank President Wilfinson said recently, Governor, that U.S. contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been. Is that a problem for you? Do you think -- what is your -- what is your idea about what the United States' obligations are? I'm talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other countries, the poor countries.\n Well, I mentioned Third World debt.\n Sure.\n That's a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way, influence nations. I believe we ought to have foreign aid, but I don't think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid. I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform. I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently. One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation. I think the IMF has got a role in the world, but I don't want to see the IMF out there as a way to say to world bankers, if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out. It needs to be available for emergency situations. I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico. But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves. So I'll look at every place where we're investing money. I just want to make sure the return is good.\n Do you think we're ",
    "Good evening from Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News. I want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. \nAs Jim Lehrer told you before the first one, these debates are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. \nTonight the topic will be domestic affairs, but the format will be the same as that first debate. I'll moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates, but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me. I have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are. \nTo refresh your memory on the rules, I will ask a question. The candidate is allowed two minutes to answer. His opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal. \nAt my discretion, I can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds. \nA green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left. A yellow light signals 15 seconds left. A red light means five seconds left. \nThere is also a buzzer, if it is needed. \nThe candidates may not question each other directly. There are no opening statements, but there will be two-minute closing statements. \nThere is an audience here tonight, but they have agreed to remain silent, except for right now, when they join me in welcoming President George Bush and Senator John Kerry. \n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. \nBy coin toss, the first question goes to Senator Kerry. \nSenator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight. \nAnd that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up? \n Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight. \nThank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us. \nAnd thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here. \nMr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people. \nWill we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal. \nNow, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it. \nI believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be. \nThe measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough. \nPeople who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program. \nSo we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists. \nI will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe. \nBut I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure. \n Mr. President, you have 90 seconds. \n Thank you very much. \nI want to thank Arizona State as well. \nYes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world. \nI have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the Al Qaida, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of Al Qaida leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account. \nAs a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march. \nWe held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein. \nIn other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan. My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling. I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people. \nAt home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it. \nWe're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports. \nBut absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership. \n Anything to add, Senator Kerry? \n Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped. \nSix months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, \"Where is Osama bin Laden? \" He said, \"I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned. \"\nWe need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror. \n Mr. President? \n Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations. \nOf course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden. \nMy opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected. \n New question, Mr. President, to you. \nWe are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year. \nSuddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen? \n Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country. We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season. \nMy call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young. \nThe CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly. \nI haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated. \nWe have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine. \nOne of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law. \nBut the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot. \n Senator Kerry? \n This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years. \nFive million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all. \nAll across our country -- go to Ohio, 1. 4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush. \nThis president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans. \nChildren across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it. \nI have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves. \n Mr. President, would you like to add something? \n I would. Thank you. \nI want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for. \nHe just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. \nIt's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch. \n Time's up. \n Thank you. \n Actually, it's not an empty promise. \nIt's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice. \nWhat we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs. \nBut the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing. \n All right. \nSenator Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health-care costs, as you are talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. \nMy question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? \n I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go. \nDuring the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how. \nPresident Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this. He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1. 6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today. \nNow, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s. \nEvery plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those. \nAnd we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get. \nWe shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job. They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China. \nI'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education. \nI have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks. \nThis president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that. \n Mr. President? \n Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record. \nHe been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times. He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4. 2 trillion. \nHe talks about PAYGO. I'll tell you what PAYGO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends. \nHe's proposed $2. 2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account. \nThere is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class. \nI propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress. \n Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs. \nYou know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual. \nMr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States? \n I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college. \nWe've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. \nYou know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works. \nI went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America. They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics. \nAnd so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late. \nNo, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive. \nGot four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma. \nAnd so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century. And that's what I would say to that person. \n Senator Kerry? \n I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally. \nLet me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility. \nBeing lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country. \n\nThis president has taken a $5. 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year. \nBut guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing. \nAnd the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year. \nThey've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college. \nThey've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed. \nI'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect. \n New question to you, Senator Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs. You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault. \nSo I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs? \n I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it. \nOutsourcing is going to happen. I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, \"Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing? \"And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, \"No, I can't do that. \"\nWhat I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job. \nToday, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. \nSo if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, \"Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America. \"\nThat's not smart. I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job. And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here. \nThe second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months. \nThe fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it. \nThe fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for. I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact. \nPlus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better. \n Mr. President? \n Whew!\nLet me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements. He said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact. \nYou know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers. \nYou've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed. \nIf you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket. \nIf you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage. \nWe created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief. \nIt's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, \"We're going to spend the government's money. \"No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want. \nI believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives. \nMy opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric. \nHe voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times. \n Senator Kerry? \n Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that. \nI have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts. \nBut you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money. \nBut they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money. \nWe have more people who qualify. That's not what we want. \n Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times. \nHe voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts. \n Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here. \nBoth of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question. Do you believe homosexuality is a choice? \n You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that. \nAnd I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live. \nAnd that's to be honored. \nBut as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. \nI proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution. \nIt has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution. \nI'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. \nMy opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman. \nBut I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests. \n Senator Kerry? \n We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as. \nI think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it. \nAnd I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them. \nI think we have to respect that. \nThe president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. \nBut I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people. \nYou can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth. \nNow, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately. \n Senator Kerry, a new question for you. \nThe New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research. \nWhat is your reaction to that? \n I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many. \nI believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith. \nI believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that. \nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade. \nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to. \nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade. \nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me. \nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, \"I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. \"\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, \"What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. \"\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people. \nThat's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth. \nThat's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith. \nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service. \n Mr. President? \n I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions. \nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law. \nWhat I'm saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs. \nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion. \n Mr. President, let's have a new question. It goes to you. And let's get back to economic issues. \nHealth insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to The Washington Post. We're paying more. We're getting less. \nI would like to ask you: Who bears responsibility for this? Is it the government? Is it the insurance companies? Is it the lawyers? Is it the doctors? Is it the administration? \n Gosh, I sure hope it's not the administration. \nThere's a -- no, look, there's a systemic problem. Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process. Most health-care costs are covered by third parties. And therefore, the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care. And there's no market forces involved with health care. \nIt's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts. These are accounts that allow somebody to buy a low-premium, high-deductible catastrophic plan and couple it with tax-free savings. Businesses can contribute, employees can contribute on a contractual basis. But this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decision-making process on health care. \nSecondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America. That's why I'm such a strong believer in medical liability reform. \nIn the last debate, my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent. Well, he didn't include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some $28 billion a year and costs our society between $60 billion and $100 billion a year. \nThirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology. It's like if you looked at the -- it's the equivalent of the buggy and horse days, compared to other industries here in America. \nAnd so, we've got to introduce high technology into health care. We're beginning to do it. We're changing the language. We want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error, as well as reduce cost. \nPeople tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system. \nAnd finally, moving generic drugs to the market quicker. \nAnd so, those are four ways to help control the costs in health care. \n Senator Kerry? \n The reason health-care costs are getting higher, one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of common-sense efforts that would have reduced the costs. Let me give you a prime example. \nIn the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada. But the president and his friends took it out in the House, and now you don't have that right. The president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from Canada. \nWe also wanted Medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing. The VA does that. The VA provides lower-cost drugs to our veterans. We could have done that in Medicare. \nMedicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty. \nBut rather than help you, the taxpayer, have lower cost, rather than",
    "  My name is Bonnie Rindner and I was born in San Antonio, TX, and the story I'm going to tell is about my mother.\n         Um, a little background first.\n         Her, let's see, her mother's family were wealthy people at one time.\n         They owned car dealerships and extensive land.\n         Um, I don't know if they were farmers or not, but I know they were land owners, um, many acres and, um, her grandmother was raised in wealth.\n         Uh, then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money.\n         Um, she was raised in MO, and she married a man, this is my grandmother I'm talking about.\n         And they were very poor by this point, and they had, I think, seven children.\n         And one particular Christmas, things were very, very difficult.\n         There was no money to buy any presents at all, um, for the children, and my grandfather, who was killed when my mother was 16, this was, of course, way before that, um, he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he, he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves.\n         Um, I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love.\n         And although I never met my grandfather, I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful, wonderful person he must have been.\n      \n      \n         And how long have you lived in Charlotte?\n      \n      \n         Oh, I have lived in Charlotte, um, for a year.\n         Um, I lived in Charlotte for five years.\n         We came here in 1986, we lived here for five years, then we moved to Raleigh for seven years and now we've been back one year.\n      \n      \n         Well, good.\n      \n   ",
    " Hi my name is Sandra Reid and I am part of a family of seven children, um, and my mom and dad have passed away.\n         During our young years we were very poor.\n         \n         We did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained, and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories, reading poems, and singing to us.\n         One of the stories that I would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind, I guess, mostly, mainly because it was scary.\n         Even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were OK.\n         Out of all of my sisters and brothers I was the laziest one of all, as far as working around the house.\n         All of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight.\n         I learned after I got married\n         so I was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking.\n         So one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes.\n         Naturally, I start crying, and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me, either my stomach, or that I had a headache, or something was wrong with my leg.\n         Just anything to get out of doing my job.\n         So after she noticed that I was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow, do what she tell told me to do, she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family.\n         So she began to tell this story.\n         Once upon a time there was this little girl and her family.\n         And the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up, wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table.\n         And her little girl just complained, \"I don't want to wash the dishes.\n         I don't want to.\n         My leg hurts, my head hurts.\n         I don't feel good.\"\n         The little girl disappointed her mother so badly, but her mother said, \"How in the world am I ever going to get her to wash these dishes?\"\n         So she said, \"Little girl, little girl, if you don't go in there and wash those dishes like I asked, you something really, really bad is going to happen to you.\"\n         So the little girl just said, \"OK I'll go in there and wash the dishes.\"\n         And she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time.\n         All of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air.\n         And before you know it, the butcher knife came around and cut the little girl's head off.\n         And when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying \"Daddy, Daddy!\n         Mama cut my head off with the butcher knife.\"\n         Now that knife, when I went to sleep it really scared me.\n         But the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that I was OK.\n         Now after that, my mother continued to tell us many, many scary stories and tell us many, many, many poems.\n         I'd like to tell you about how I got into becoming a teacher's assistant.\n         All my life I always wanted to be a teacher even from the time I started to school.\n         That was my dream, to teach school.\n         As I told you, in the past we were a very poor family and I never got the chance to go to college because of this.\n         Uh, while I was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that I had an extra bone in my foot and she said, \"Well now Sandra we can use this as get toward, on your grant to go to college.\"\n         So she said, \"Go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we, you know, can follow through with applying for a grant, scholarship grant for you.\"\n         So that night I went home and I asked my mother about it and she said, \"Baby, I really want you to go to college.\n         It's always been my dream that my children all go to school.\n         But because there are so many children in the family there are other things you're going to have to have to go to school and I just don't have the money.\"\n         At that time my dad was in prison at the time, so it made it really hard for my mom.\n         I sat there and I cried but I tried to be as understanding as possible because I knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us.\n         So I never got a chance to go to school.\n      \n      \n         Did anybody?\n      \n      \n         Yes, my brother went to school.\n         He went to Livingstone and then to transferred to Johnson C. Smith, so to make it easier on my mom, to, as far as, you know, him staying at home and going to school too.\n         So he graduated from, um, Johnson C. Smith, here in Charlotte.\n         I had another sister who went to Gaston College where she got a business degree there.\n         I, in later years, I went on to college some but I didn't complete the, uh, whole four years.\n         Um, I remember once, when I was working in a mill, and I was spinning yarn, and I was saying to myself, and, I was praying actually, and I said, \"God, one day I want to work in the school system.\n         If I could just work, even as a teacher assistant I would be happy.\"\n         As the years went by my prayer was answered and I got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said, \"Have you considered being a teacher assistant?\"\n         I said, \"I would love to.\"\n         So they told me about some classes that I could take at Central Piedmont.\n         I'd never gone to college before.\n         I was really afraid.\n         But he told me to go ahead and try it, so I took the entrance test, and they accepted me into at the school, and I took some courses there.\n         After a while, the principal said, \"I would like for you to bring me your, um, transcript so I can see what your grades are like.\"\n         Luckily I had all A's.\n         I did very well.\n         And he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year.\n         Um, my dream, my prayers were answered.\n         I enjoy my job very much.\n         I can't think of any job that would make me any happier.\n         A few years later, um, I had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education.\n         At first I didn't want to apply for it, but the principal called me during the summer months and said, \"Sandra the time is running out, you need to apply.\"\n         And he told me I would have to write this paper.\n         Well I didn't like writing at the time\n         but I took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper.\n         And I went to, um, one of my staff members and I asked her if she would proofread it, and she thought it was an excellent paper.\n         And I went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh I won't get the scholarship.\n         Who cares?\n         I don't, just so I can work in the school I'll be happy.\n         But one day I came in and I looked at my mail and I was accepted.\n         \n         I couldn't believe it.\n         Out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity, so I felt very proud of myself.\n         So I went on and took the courses, and as I started I think I was taking economics.\n         I think that was the last class I took.\n         My husband became very ill with cancer and I had to make a decision as to whether I would continue my education or take care of him and I felt like I needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while I was going to school.\n      \n      \n         But you would have been able to be a, a teacher if you had continued?\n      \n      \n         Yeah, and at the time, I was also working in the classroom.\n         I guess you'd say as a sub because the teacher that I was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence.\n         And they hired a sub but the sub didn't do that much.\n         I had to take over the classroom.\n         So I worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting\n         to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that I was taking care of a very sick husband.\n         After all of this was, after I, I decided not to continue I've never pursued the fact of going back to school.\n         I just got to a certain age and I said, \"No I can't do this anymore,\" so I never went back.\n         But I love what I do and, uh, anytime I get a chance to teach in a classroom I go for it so.\n      \n      \n         How many different schools did you teach at?\n      \n      \n         I've only worked at two, two schools.\n         The first school I worked at was Enderly Park and then it was closed down.\n         So I was in those situations where I first, come first, transfer last, come first to transfer out.\n         So I had to, I was offered a job at Ashley Park or Berryhill and I chose Berryhill.\n         I didn't particularly want to come here and when I came here everybody noticed that I was really, really sad because I loved being at Enderly Park.\n         But then, after awhile, I fell in love with Berryhill.\n         If I'm not mistaken I think I've been at Berryhill for I think 17 years, 17, 18 years I've been here at Berryhill so and I hope I never have to leave until I retire.\n         \n      \n      \n         And why did the other school close down?\n      \n      \n         Um, the, you know, I really don't know.\n         Um, that, I really don't know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything, but they eventually tore it down because I was there I think the first year I went there was the year they built a really nice gym, and I don't think they used that gym no more than three years.\n         I really don't, I don't remember why that school was ever closed but it was.\n         And I enjoy what I do.\n         That's it.\n      \n      \n         All right thank you.\n      \n      \n         Thank you.\n      \n   ",
    "How Are Lab Grown Diamonds Made?\nWhether it\u2019s a ring, a bracelet, earrings or a necklace, diamonds can easily take your look to the next level. You can go from simple to glam in seconds with the help of a few dazzling adornments. Diamonds are revered and are commonly seen as a symbol of commitment, being the stone of choice for engagement and wedding rings. If you\u2019re in the market for a new diamond you may have heard about lab grown diamonds, but it can all be a bit confusing. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about lab grown diamonds and how they are made.\n\nWhat Are Lab Grown Diamonds?\nLab grown diamonds are known by many names: lab grown diamonds, cultured diamonds, man made diamonds, synthetic diamonds along with many others. Regardless of what you call them, they certainly have created a wave in the diamond industry.\n\nSo what are they? Simply put, they are diamonds grown in a lab. These labs use cutting-edge technology to replicate the natural processes that create diamonds found in the earth. The end result is a lab created diamond that is the same as a mined diamond chemically, physically and optically.\n\n\nAre They Real Diamonds?\nIn short, yes. Lab grown diamonds are real diamonds.\n\nThe long answer is that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) defines a diamond as pure crystallized carbon in the isometric cubic system, whether it is mined from the earth or grown in a lab. The FTC has chosen this definition of a diamond as both lab grown diamonds and mined diamonds have the same chemical, optical and physical properties. This means that regardless of the origin, crystallized carbon is a gemstone known as a diamond.\n\nLab grown diamonds are identical to diamonds found in the earth in every way. Both share the same qualities and characteristics such as:\n\n\nSo whether it is mined or grown in a lab, a diamond is a diamond.\n\nHow Lab Grown Diamonds Compare to Mined Diamonds\nLab grown diamonds are manufactured using conditions that mimic the natural process that creates earth grown diamonds. This means that carbon is subjected to high temperatures and high pressure in a controlled environment. The end result is a diamond.\n\nDiamonds pulled from the earth are thought to have been formed 1 to 3 billion years ago. However, scientists believe that they were formed from carbon dioxide being exposed to extreme temperatures (2,000+ Fahrenheit) and extreme pressure (about 727,000 pounds per square inch). These conditions are found approximately 90 miles below the Earth\u2019s surface. Once formed, these diamonds were moved from the Earth\u2019s core to its crust by volcanic explosions.\n\nThe process of making a diamond in a lab is much more efficient. Labs use two different methods to grow diamonds\u2014High Pressure-High Temperature (HPHT) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD).\n\nHPHT\nWhen the HPHT method is used, a small diamond seed is placed into a piece of carbon. Then using either a belt press, cubic press or a split-sphere (BARS) press, the carbon is pressurized to approximately 1.5 million pounds per square inch. Additionally, the carbon is also exposed to temperatures over 2,700 Fahrenheit. This pressure and heat begin to melt the carbon, forming a diamond around the initial diamond seed. The newly formed diamond is then carefully cooled.\n\nCVD\nLike HPHT, CVD uses a small diamond seed (often an HPHT diamond). This seed is placed inside a sealed chamber that is heated to over 1,400 Fahrenheit and filled with carbon-rich gases (typically methane and hydrogen). These gases are then ionized into plasma using a technology similar to lasers or microwaves. This technology essentially breaks down the molecular bond of the gas. Once the molecular bond is broken down, pure carbon begins to stick to the seed and a new diamond forms. Additional treatments may be used (heat or irradiation) to enhance or change the diamond\u2019s color after it is grown.\n\n\nHow Long Does It Take to Grow a Lab Grown Diamond?\nUnlike the billions of years it takes to create mined diamonds, lab grown diamonds typically take less than a month to grow. White diamonds take the longest time to grow, with it taking 2+ weeks to grow a 1-carat diamond. On the other hand, yellow and blue diamonds take 5-10 days. It is important that the growing process is not rushed when making diamonds. If the process is rushed the crystal will fracture.\n\nBenefits of Lab Grown Diamonds\nDiamonds that are grown in a lab feature many different benefits that add to their value and are equally as beautiful as diamonds found in the earth. But beauty isn\u2019t the only thing that lab grown diamonds have going for them. Lab grown diamonds have many benefits that appeal to consumers.\n\nSocially Responsible\nOne of the major benefits of lab grown diamonds is that you know exactly where the diamond originated. Many traditional mined diamonds come from conflict regions. This has raised both ethical and humanitarian concerns. The diamond industry has been linked to child labor, poor working conditions, human rights violations and funding armed conflicts. With lab grown diamonds, you can have peace of mind knowing your diamond wasn\u2019t involved in the blood diamond trade.\n\nSmaller Environmental Impact\nMining for diamonds has a tremendous impact on the environment. Between 88,000 and 176,000 pounds of dirt must be sifted through to find a single 1-carat diamond. While the diamond industry, or rather one company in particular, has pushed the false belief that diamonds are rare, we now know the truth. Diamonds are not rare. Never have been and never will be thanks to advanced technology.\n\nLess Expensive\nWith lab grown diamonds, you\u2019ll be able to get a bigger stone or higher quality for your budget. This is because lab grown diamonds can be up to 40% less expensive than traditional mined diamonds of the same quality. As processes of creating lab grown diamonds continue to improve, the difference in price between the two types of diamonds is likely to continue to grow.\n\nBetter Quality for the Price\nLab grown diamonds are made in a controlled environment, although each diamond will differ in quality similar to mined diamonds. Every lab diamond is graded using the 4Cs of Diamond Quality: cut, color, clarity and carat weight. This is true for both lab diamonds and mined diamonds. The price of a diamond is determined based on how it performs on each of these categories. So while no two diamonds will be exactly the same, whether lab grown or pulled from the earth, you can get a better quality for the same amount you would spend on a mined diamond.\n\nCan You Tell the Difference Between Lab Grown and Mined Diamonds?\nLab grown diamonds are identical to mined diamonds. Even to the trained eye, it is impossible to tell the difference between a diamond grown in a lab and an earth mined diamond. Distinguishing between the two requires a trained gemologist and sophisticated equipment specifically designed for identifying lab grown diamonds. Traditional observations and diamond-detectors cannot tell the two kinds of diamonds apart from one another since they are identical both chemically and optically. So, a lab grown diamond and a mined diamond will look the same and you won\u2019t be able to tell the difference because they\u2019re identical in every way.\n\n\nCertification and Grading\nLike mined diamonds, lab grown diamonds come with a grading report. Common reports come from International Gemological Institute (IGI) and Gem Certification & Assurance Lab (GCAL), although there are many other graders out there. These reports include a grade for each of the 4Cs as well as verification that it was grown in a lab, if applicable. A diamond engagement ring is a big financial decision, which is why these grading reports give you peace of mind that you\u2019re getting the diamond quality that you expect.\n\nIs a Lab Grown Diamond for Me?\nUltimately, the decision to buy a lab grown diamond is a personal one. If you love the look of diamonds but are hesitant because mined diamonds don\u2019t align with your personal values, a lab grown diamond may be just the solution you\u2019ve been looking for. These real diamonds are becoming an accessible luxury that you can indulge in with a peace of mind that you simply can\u2019t get with mined diamonds.",
    "Puppies are beyond adorable, but let's face it \u2014 raising a puppy is fraught with challenges. If you've never had a puppy before, the task before you can seem quite daunting, and once those big puppy eyes capture your heart, there's no turning back. Here are some helpful tips to get through the puppy development stage and ensure your new four-legged baby grows up into a happy, healthy, well-adjusted dog.\n\nPuppies are little bundles of energy who are often intensely curious about their surroundings. Life with a puppy is not that different from life with a human toddler\u2014you'll need a lot of patience as you watch over your pup to keep him out of trouble, instruct him in appropriate behavior and safely teach him about the world.\n\nThe good news is that puppies sleep a lot, although they don't always sleep through the night, and your pup may wake the household whining and barking to express his displeasure at being left alone. Puppies are also driven to chew a lot as their adult teeth come in, and may see the doggie version of a teething ring in the living room rug, the couch, your favorite pair of shoes and even your hand. If you become frustrated with your new pet, it's important to remember that the task of raising a puppy is temporary. He'll be all grown up by his first birthday, and he'll leave most of his puppy tendencies behind as he settles into adulthood.\n\nIf you just got a puppy or are getting ready to go pick up your little bundle of joy, you need to be prepared for the new responsibility that is another life. This means taking time out of your busy schedule to tend to his needs. So, if you are planning on getting a puppy, it is a good idea to do so when you can take time off work, or work from home, to spend with him. This will allow you to let him out to do his business frequently, as well as monitor behaviors that he might try to engage in when you're away from the home.\n\nPuppy-proofing Your Home\nIt's impossible to provide constant supervision for your energetic, curious pup, so it's important to prepare your home before letting him loose in it. Secure electrical cords and move potentially toxic plants or substances, such as cleaning supplies and insecticides, out of reach. It's a good idea to crawl through your home to get a puppy's-eye view of his surroundings. Remove anything he might be tempted to chew or swallow, and close off vents, pet doors or any other openings that might allow him to become lost or stuck. Not only will this help keep him safe, it will also ease your anxiety that your new pup is lost.\n\nYou'll need to be ready to start house training your pup as soon as you bring him home. If you plan to crate train him, have the crate ready. Make it comfortable by lining it with blankets or a dog bed, but make sure it's large enough that he'll have plenty of room to stand up, turn around, and lie down. Slowly introduce him to the crate by leaving the door open and letting him explore it on his own. You can help tempt him to go in by throwing in a toy or a couple of pieces of food. The more comfortable he is with going into the crate, the easier it will be on both of you during training.\n\nIf you're forgoing a crate, prepare a small area, such as a powder room or a corner of a kitchen or laundry room, where he can be confined and kept away from other pets and small children. Be sure to provide some puppy training pads to catch any accidents, and include a dog bed, his food and water dishes and a toy or two. This area will serve as home base, a safe space from which he can slowly be introduced to the other members of your household and that provides a retreat when he becomes overwhelmed or needs a time out.\n\nSupplies You'll Need\nYou'll need to stock up on a number of supplies to keep your puppy happy and healthy.\n\nPuppy Nutrition\nPuppies have different nutrient and energy requirements than adult dogs. Look for a high quality puppy food that is specially formulated to support puppy development and growth. The proper quantity of food depends on factors like age, size, and breed. It's a good idea to consult your vet about how much and how often to feed your pup.\n\nFor some small breeds, it can be best to free feed young pups to ensure they receive adequate nutrition. Toy and small breed dogs reach physical maturity faster than larger breeds, and can be switched over to adult dog food and adult-sized portions between nine and twelve months of age.\n\nLarger breeds can take a full two years to reach physical maturity, and should stick with a puppy formula during that time. They should also be fed multiple meals each day with controlled portions to prevent complications, such as stomach bloat and buildup of excess protein or calcium, which could lead to conditions like hip dysplasia. A structured feeding schedule for your larger breed pup could look something like this:\n\nSix to twelve weeks old: Four meals per day\nThree to six months old: Three meals per day\nSix months and up: Two meals per day\nTraining and Socialization\nBrown Australian Shepherd puppy peeing on the grass with other puppies in the background\nYou'll want to begin house training right away. Dogs instinctively try to avoid soiling their bed and the area around it, so keeping him confined to a small area or crate as he gets used to going outside will be key, says Dog Star Daily. Establish a potty routine, keeping in mind that young puppies will typically need to go out once every couple of hours. Until he's had all his vaccinations, take him to a section of the yard where he won't be exposed to other animals. When he successfully relieves himself outdoors, be sure to lavish him with praise and reward him with a treat.\n\nWhen it comes to both house training and establishing the rules of appropriate conduct, it's important to be patient with your pup and use positive reinforcement to build happy associations with correct behavior. It's generally best to ignore unwanted behavior, or correct your pup with a simple but firm \"no.\" Never hit or yell at your pup\u2014this will only confuse him and cause him to feel anxious and fearful. When he engages in negative behavior try and direct him back to something positive. For instance, if he is chewing on something he shouldn't be, direct him back to one of his toys. As soon as he's old enough, consider enrolling him in an obedience class. This will not only teach him how to behave, but will also help promote socialization and provide you with the skills to properly train him.\n\nProper socialization is a key element of successfully raising a puppy. In order for him to grow up into a well-adjusted dog, he needs to be exposed to as many new people, places, experiences and situations as possible. While you should wait until he's had all his vaccinations before taking him out in public or letting him get close to other animals, you can start socializing your pup right away by simply playing with him and introducing him to new people, sights, sounds, smells, and textures.\n\nYour Puppy's Health\nOne of the first steps to take after getting your new puppy is to schedule a wellness visit with a veterinarian. If you don't already have an established vet, ask around. Your family, friends and coworkers will likely be able to provide you with plenty of recommendations.\n\nAt his first appointment, your vet will check your puppy for any health problems or parasites, and will likely recommend a program for controlling parasites, such as fleas, ticks and heartworms. She'll also establish a vaccination schedule and advise you on when you should bring him in to be neutered, which can help reduce the risk of health and behavioral problems as he gets older.\n\nYour vet can also answer any questions or concerns you have about caring for your pup, such as what type of food to feed him and how much he should be given. Either your vet or the veterinary assistant can also advise you on aspects of puppy care such as tooth brushing and nail trimming, and can even show you how it's properly done.\n\nWhile you're at the vet you can try and schedule his 6-month vet visit. This vet will use this visit to check on the growth and progress of your pup to make sure everything looks good from a health perspective. They can even start to give you tips on preparing you as you go through the adolescent period, which can be a challenging time for pet parents as pups grow into sexual maturity. This also is a good chance to talk about what to expect as your pup grows into adulthood.\n\nPuppy Play\nOutside of training and general health, puppies need attention and exercise. The good news is that this doesn't always mean walks around the block, jogging throughout the neighborhood, or trips to the dog park. Playing with your puppy is often enough exercise to keep him healthy while building a bond between the both of you. Games like fetch, tug-of-war and hide-and-seek are all games that can be played within the home to help release pent up energy he might have gotten from being home alone all day. Make sure to take 15-30 minutes every day to play with him in addition to walking him or letting him in your backyard to run around.\n\nGrooming\nEven dogs that don't require a trim every few weeks need some sort of grooming. Starting the grooming process while your pup is still young will make it much easier on you. Grooming includes trimmings, brushing his coat, his teeth, trimming his nails and bathing him. You can absolutely hire a professional groomer for haircuts or the vet for nail trimming, but you'll want to get your dog used to having to sit still while you primp and preen him. Get him used to the feeling of a brush in his fur, this is especially true of dogs that shed a lot or are prone to matting. Bathing your puppy can be a chore in itself, so come in prepared with plenty of towels (and clothes you're not afraid to get wet in) and slowly introduce him to the shampoo and water. As he starts to get more comfortable, this process will become easier. Finally, brushing his teeth may seem strange to a lot of pet owners, but it can go a long way to protecting your dog's mouth. Here are some tips to getting your puppy used to you brushing his teeth.\n\nRaising a puppy is not an easy task, but it's an adventure that's full of rewards as you develop a deep bond with your pup that will last throughout his life. A lot of patience and a little extra effort will turn your rambunctious pupper into a fun-loving gentleman that will make all the effort that goes into his development worthwhile.",

    "How Olivia Rodrigo went from Disney princess to pop queen: 'I\u2019ve only ever seen myself as a songwriter'\n\nOlivia Rodrigo does not, as a general rule, read the comments.\n\n\u201cSometimes you see one thing and then you\u2019re thinking about it all day,\u201d says the 18-year-old singer and songwriter responsible for 2021\u2019s biggest debut album. \u201cIt\u2019s the antithesis of good creativity.\u201d\n\nLate one night last May, though, she made an exception. Rodrigo\u2019s smash LP, \u201cSour,\u201d had just come out, and with it a lyric video on YouTube for the album\u2019s empathy bomb of a closer, \u201cHope Ur OK.\u201d Over layers of dreamy electric guitar, the song stitches together \u201cstories that I\u2019ve collected throughout my life,\u201d Rodrigo says, \u201cof people that I\u2019ve known who\u2019ve grown up in broken homes or have parents that didn\u2019t accept them.\u201d\n\nWith its focus on the trauma of others \u2014 a middle-school friend whose parents \u201chated who she loved,\u201d a towhead blond who \u201cwore long sleeves \u2019cause of his dad\u201d \u2014 \u201cHope Ur OK\u201d is in some ways an outlier on \u201cSour,\u201d which otherwise takes a proudly autobiographical approach to the pleasures and torments of young love in songs such as Rodrigo\u2019s pair of No. 1 hit singles, the gloriously melodramatic \u201cDrivers License\u201d and the gloriously caustic \u201cGood 4 U.\u201d But it also demonstrates this Disney Channel veteran\u2019s desire to reflect something of her generation. So Rodrigo was curious to see how it had landed.\n\n\u201cI was literally just crying,\u201d she recalls of her midnight scroll, which brought up the appreciative words of a girl forced to raise her younger siblings and of a trans kid \u201ckicked out at 17,\u201d as one commenter wrote. \u201cSeeing people share their own experiences of things that were so devastating, and how this song gave them hope \u2014 I just didn\u2019t expect anything like that to come out of my album.\u201d\n\nThe fans she\u2019d moved were just a fraction of the millions she\u2019s made in the whirlwind 11 months since \u201cDrivers License\u201d dropped in early January and became an instant pop phenomenon. A slow-building power ballad about a young woman sobbing as she motors through the suburbs in the wake of a painful breakup, \u201cDrivers License\u201d seemed to channel an eternal ache even as it cleverly nodded to a bit of real-life gossip involving Rodrigo and fellow Disney performer Joshua Bassett.\n\nThe song topped Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks and inspired a sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d; eventually it helped propel \u201cSour\u201d to a No. 1 bow of its own. Spotify reported that \u201cDrivers License\u201d was its most streamed song of 2021 and \u201cSour\u201d its most streamed album; Apple Music stated that more of its users read the lyrics of \u201cDrivers License\u201d this year than read those of any other song \u2014 a distinction that might please Rodrigo even more than the rest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only ever seen myself as a songwriter,\u201d she says over lunch on L.A.\u2019s Westside. \u201cI remember the first time an article said, \u2018Olivia Rodrigo is the next big pop star\u2019 \u2014 I was like, There are so many things that go along with \u2018pop star\u2019 that I never thought I\u2019d be.\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s capping her breakout year with seven Grammy nominations, including nods in the four major categories of album of the year, record and song of the year (both for \u201cDrivers License\u201d) and best new artist. Rodrigo is the 13th person in Grammys history to score all four nominations in the same year, following the likes of Tracy Chapman, Mariah Carey, Amy Winehouse and an earlier Gen Z sensation, Billie Eilish, who actually went on to win the awards in 2020.\n\nCount Rodrigo as a fan. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with her new record,\u201d she says of Eilish\u2019s \u201cHappier Than Ever,\u201d which deals frankly with the psycho-emotional fallout of becoming a global celebrity in one\u2019s teens \u2014 and which, as it happens, is among \u201cSour\u2019s\u201d competition for album of the year.\n\nSo far, Rodrigo says, her own rapid ascent has been largely positive. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018What a weird life, huh?\u2019 But I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably not unlike the drastic change that another kid at 18 would have going to college.\u201d That might be a stretch: In July, Rodrigo visited the White House to meet with President Biden and publicly encourage young people to get vaccinated. (One interesting outcome of her trip was finding out that certain unspecified people in her life had chosen not to get a shot. \u201cNot everyone can think the way I do,\u201d she says.)\n\nThe pop-star workload, she allows, is intense. When was her last day off? \u201cJesus, I don\u2019t even know,\u201d she says, before remembering that she and a friend spent a few nights at a resort in Santa Barbara in October. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost all stuff I want to do. Even on my days off I love writing songs.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re sitting in a private dining room in an upscale Italian joint not far from Rodrigo\u2019s apartment \u2014 the first she\u2019s ever lived in on her own. Dressed in a powder-blue top and chunky boots, she orders ravioli and a sampling of meat skewers to share. Her mother\u2019s a vegetarian, and Rodrigo grew up that way too. \u201cUntil one day when I was like, I just want chicken tenders so bad,\u201d she says. \u201cOrdered the tenders and never went back.\u201d\n\nRodrigo\u2019s iPhone sits on the table in front of her, but when it lights up with a text, she turns it over. Does the ease with which she could type out something right now and set her 19.6 million Instagram followers aflutter ever blow her mind?\n\n\u201cCompletely,\u201d she says. \u201cI kind of can\u2019t think about it \u2014 it\u2019s paralyzing.\u201d She says she always has someone on her team look over what she\u2019s written before she posts; she also has a parental lock on her social media apps that limits her to 30 minutes a day. \u201cI can\u2019t override it, so once I\u2019m done, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\n\nRodrigo has a song called \u201cJealousy, Jealousy\u201d explicitly about the moral hazards of a \u201ctoxic internet culture,\u201d as she puts it, in which \u201cpeople talk about women\u2019s bodies in a way that\u2019s completely unjust.\u201d But even the most intimate material on \u201cSour\u201d plays out against a kind of larger social backdrop; Rodrigo always seems in touch with the systems and institutions that have shaped her behaviors and appetites \u2014 the movies and websites and magazine covers that sell an often-unfulfilled fantasy of romance.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so self-aware,\u201d says Daniel Nigro, who produced \u201cSour,\u201d and indeed there\u2019s an instinctive understanding to Rodrigo\u2019s work that links her to other gifted Zoomers like Gracie Abrams and Holly Humberstone (and reveals the influence of slightly older songwriters like Taylor Swift and Phoebe Bridgers, whose live show Rodrigo recently caught at L.A.\u2019s Greek Theatre).\n\n\u201cGen Z in particular has such a bulls\u2014 barometer,\u201d Rodrigo says. \u201cWe want to know what\u2019s behind everything.\u201d At the same time, she sees her and her friends\u2019 fascination with the late \u201990s and early 2000s \u2014 \u201cMy Pinterest is just old Winona Ryder and Gwyneth Paltrow pictures,\u201d she says \u2014 as a subconscious longing for \u201ca time when everything wasn\u2019t so at the tip of your fingers and hyper-exposed.\u201d\n\nBridgers returns Rodrigo\u2019s admiration. \u201cOlivia\u2019s music is so exacting \u2014 it makes you feel something,\u201d she says. In Bridgers\u2019 view, the record industry usually \u201ctries to defame musicians that teenage girls love, even though they forget that teenage girls invented the Beatles.\u201d But the acclaim for Rodrigo has been encouraging: \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see people finally be taken seriously at her age.\u201d\n\nRodrigo, whose mom is white and dad is Filipino American, grew up in Temecula convinced she\u2019d be an Olympic gymnast. \u201cI was terrible at it \u2014 terrible!\u201d she says now. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018Mom and Dad, this is what we\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d An only child, she was always into music; her mom, an elementary school teacher, took her record shopping at Goodwill and Amoeba and taught her about grunge and riot grrrl: L7, Hole, Babes in Toyland. (\u201cBrutal,\u201d \u201cSour\u2019s\u201d cheerfully blistering opener, has some serious Bikini Kill energy.) Her first concert was a Weezer gig at the Del Mar Fairgrounds her parents dragged her to; later she begged them to take her to see Carrie Underwood.\n\n\u201cI was a big country girl when I was younger,\u201d she says. One of her key Goodwill finds? A Tanya Tucker greatest-hits LP featuring \u201cDelta Dawn,\u201d which Tucker recorded when she was 13. \u201cThe song isn\u2019t about her \u2014 she\u2019s literally telling someone else\u2019s story,\u201d Rodrigo says of the early-\u201970s character study. \u201cAs a young kid, I was like, That\u2019s so cool.\u201d\n\nRodrigo started singing and writing songs before she hit double digits, and soon she was giving up gymnastics to belt adult-size ballads at little-kid talent shows. At 13 she was cast on the Disney Channel\u2019s \u201cBizaardvark,\u201d about a group of teenage internet content creators; among her co-stars was Jake Paul, the shock-merchant YouTuber turned pro boxing villain.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since he left the show,\u201d Rodrigo says of her old castmate. \u201cBut the last thing he said to me was, \u2018You\u2019re gonna sell out stadiums one day, kid.\u2019\u201d\n\nWait \u2014 Jake Paul, of all people, was the first to identify Rodrigo\u2019s pop-star potential?\n\n\u201cHe called it,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cGod, my publicist would not appreciate me saying this. He was very nice to me. I don\u2019t really follow all the stuff he does online anymore.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, Rodrigo booked the role of Nini on \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\u201d a Disney+ extension of the durable Disney Channel franchise. Last year she wrote a song for the show, the plaintive \u201cAll I Want,\u201d which went viral on TikTok and led to a deal with Geffen Records.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for a minute, and usually what you hear from young writers are parts of songs,\u201d says Sam Riback, co-head of A&R at Interscope Geffen A&M. \u201cBut with Olivia it\u2019s the whole composition that\u2019s so well put together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in the discipline of songwriting,\u201d says Rodrigo, who swears by Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s book \u201cBig Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear.\u201d \u201cShe talks about how ideas are more likely to come to you when you show up for them,\u201d Rodrigo says, adding that she wrote a song every day for the first four months of COVID-19 quarantine. (She says the voice memos app on her phone is so full that it doesn\u2019t work anymore.)\n\nShe and Nigro were equally diligent in the studio, cutting and re-cutting her vocals on every song until they were just right. One of Rodrigo\u2019s strengths as a singer is her background as an actor; she knows how to bring a lyric fully to life, as in \u201cDeja Vu,\u201d where she punctuates a verse about an ex who recycles old jokes with a bitter little chuckle that says more than words could.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019d do a take and it would be fine,\u201d she says. \u201cThen we\u2019d do it again but Dan would film me while I was singing. I\u2019d perform for the camera, and that take would be so much better.\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cSour\u201d came out, the song \u201c1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\u201d carried a co-writing credit for Swift and her producer, Jack Antonoff, because Rodrigo interpolated the piano chords from Swift\u2019s song \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day.\u201d Then, months later, after fans on YouTube made videos about the similarities between \u201cGood 4 U\u201d and Paramore\u2019s 2007 hit \u201cMisery Business,\u201d Rodrigo retroactively cut in that band\u2019s Hayley Williams and Joshua Farro as co-writers on \u201cGood 4 U\u201d (with a combined 50% share of the song\u2019s royalties, according to Billboard).\n\nAsked if the experience bummed her out, Rodrigo sighs, then spends a few seconds deciding what she wants to say. \u201cI think it\u2019s disappointing in general to see people discredit young women\u2019s abilities and talents,\u201d she says. \u201cAll music is inspired by other music, and I think it would be so cool if a girl 15 years from now wants to write a song inspired by something I made. That\u2019s the whole point of creativity.\u201d\n\nAs her public profile has grown, Rodrigo says she\u2019s stayed tight with a circle of old pals that includes \u201cBizaardvark\u2019s\u201d Madison Hu. (She\u2019s reportedly dating Adam Faze, a podcaster and film producer.) Is she ever suspicious of the motives of would-be new friends? \u201cYou can always tell \u2014 there\u2019s always a gut feeling,\u201d she says. \u201cBut sometimes I can tell and I\u2019m just like, I don\u2019t care \u2014 I still want to hang out with them.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, Rodrigo is excited to finally mount her first tour behind \u201cSour,\u201d which is scheduled to launch in April and play theaters, including the Greek in L.A. and New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall, rather than going straight into the arenas she likely could fill. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should skip any steps,\u201d says Rodrigo, who will bring Abrams and Humberstone along as opening acts. At a recent rehearsal for a TV performance, she and her band \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s all girls,\u201d she notes happily \u2014 ran through \u201cBrutal,\u201d which nearly brought a tear to her eye. \u201cSix girls on electric guitars and things, rocking out on this super-crunchy grunge song \u2014 I feel like I didn\u2019t get to see enough of that when I was a kid,\u201d she says.\n\nShe\u2019s started writing too, including one song the other day about the \u201cway that young women are so competitive with each other and tear each other down in a way that\u2019s so counterintuitive.\u201d Many of the songs on \u201cSour\u201d deal with first-time experiences and sensations, but she\u2019s not worried about aging out of that perspective. \u201cThere\u2019s always something on my mind I can talk about. I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of rap lately, and I really admire rappers for that.\u201d J. Cole\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Off-Season,\u201d is a current fave. \u201cHe can talk about anything and everything and we eat it up because he says it in such an interesting storytelling way.\u201d\n\n\nShe and Nigro have fantasized about renting an Airbnb somewhere in Italy to hunker down and focus on her follow-up album. But first she\u2019s committed to a third season of \u201cHigh School Musical,\u201d about which you have to assume she\u2019s conflicted. (Asked if \u201cBizaardvark\u201d was any good, she shakes her head, then claps her hand theatrically over her mouth, as though she\u2019s uttered some forbidden truth.)\n\nThe Disney-to-Top 40 pipeline is typically a one-way affair, and though Rodrigo\u2019s ride has been uncommonly quick, the thought of leaving music to return to a squeaky-clean kids show \u2014 well, actually, Rodrigo insists she doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cI never take a break from music,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was shooting season 2 of [\u2018High School Musical\u2019], I wrote like five of the songs on my album. So, honestly, I\u2019m probably gonna be more productive.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cBut who knows? I\u2019ve only been doing this for a year. I\u2019ve got a lot left to figure out.\u201d",
    "Dear Mr. President - Congratulations on a remarkable run. Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure.\nThis is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don't know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful. Still, let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years.\nFirst, we've both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune. Not everyone is so lucky. It's up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that's willing to work hard.\nSecond, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It's up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that's expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.\nThird, we are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions -- like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties -- that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.\nAnd finally, take time, in the rush of events and responsibilities, for friends and family. They'll get you through the inevitable rough patches.\nMichelle and I wish you and Melania the very best as you embark on this great adventure, and know that we stand ready to help in any ways which we can.\nGood luck and Godspeed,\nBO",
    "A heady mix of haunting ruins, awe-inspiring art and vibrant street life, Italy\u2019s hot-blooded capital is one of the world\u2019s most romantic and charismatic cities.\n\nThe result of 3000 years of ad hoc urban development, Rome's cityscape is an exhilarating sight. Ancient icons such as the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Pantheon recall the city\u2019s golden age as caput mundi (capital of the world), while monumental basilicas tell of its history as seat of the Catholic Church. Lording it over the skyline, St Peter\u2019s Basilica towers over the Vatican, testifying to the ambition of Rome\u2019s Renaissance popes and the genius of its game-changing architects. Elsewhere, ornate piazzas and showy fountains add a baroque flourish to the city's captivating streets.\n\n\nFew cities can rival Rome's astonishing artistic heritage. Throughout history, the city has starred in the great upheavals of Western art, drawing top artists and inspiring them to push the boundaries of creative achievement. The result is a city awash with priceless treasures. Ancient statues adorn world-class museums; Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes dazzle in art-rich churches; baroque facades flank medieval piazzas. Stroll through the centre and without even trying you\u2019ll come across masterpieces by the titans of European art \u2013 sculptures by Michelangelo, paintings by Caravaggio, frescoes by Raphael and fountains by Bernini.\n\n\nA trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture. Idling around picturesque streets, whiling away hours at streetside cafes, people-watching on pretty piazzas \u2013 these are all central to the Roman experience. The tempo rises in the evening when fashionable drinkers descend on the city\u2019s bars and cafes for a sociable aperitivo (drink with snacks) and trattorias hum with activity. Elsewhere, cheerful hordes mill around popular haunts before heading off to hip cocktail bars and late-night clubs.\n\n\nEating out is one of Rome's great pleasures and the combination of romantic alfresco settings and superlative food is a guarantee of good times. For contemporary fine dining and five-star wine there are any number of refined restaurants, but for a truly Roman meal head to a boisterous pizzeria or convivial neighbourhood trattoria. That's where the locals go to indulge their passion for thin, crispy pizzas, humble pasta dishes, and cool white wines from the nearby Castelli Romani hills. To finish off, what can beat a gelato followed by a shot of world-beating coffee?",
    "I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.\n\nFive score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.\n\nBut one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.\n\nIn a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \"insufficient funds.\"\n\nBut we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n\nWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if\nthe nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n\nBut there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must ever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\n\nThe marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.\n\nAnd as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, \"When will you be satisfied?\" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\n\nI am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends. And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n\nI have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.\n\nI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n\nI have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\nI have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!\n\nI have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today!\n\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. And this will be the day, this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, \"My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\" And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.",
    "OnePlus\u2019s Android 12-based OxygenOS 12 update has finally reached \"stable\" status. That\u2019s a label that means it shouldn\u2019t be particularly buggy and that it\u2019s rolling out \u2014 in this case, to the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. But if you\u2019ve been following customer impressions, the new release seems to be anything but stable, and the new software takes some noteworthy (and negative) departures from prior OxygenOS releases. More plainly: OxygenOS 12 is awful and feels like budget phone software on the thousand-dollar OnePlus 9 Pro.\n\nI tried as long as I could to refrain from coming to such a harsh judgment. When the first OxygenOS 12 betas landed, and Karandeep Singh warned us that it was \u201cColorOS in all but name,\u201d I had hoped (without any real evidence) that this was just a transitory step in the software merger. We all knew OPPO's divisive ColorOS was the base that both companies would be working from; they explicitly said as much. But I thought we might see OnePlus make its own changes on top to bring things back a little. After all, in the Android enthusiast community, the company was known and praised for its software for years. It\u2019s not like OnePlus would just throw away years of branding, features, design, and recognition to entirely adopt someone else\u2019s software at the drop of a hat, right? Guess again.\n\nI should point out that the first time I tried the ColorOS 12 beta, I didn\u2019t hate it. In fact, I actually liked a couple of specific software details for what they seemed to say about the company\u2019s development strategy. Still, at the time I noted that ColorOS still felt \u201cwrong\u201d to me in a way many Chinese-market-first software skins do, with OnePlus\u2019s OxygenOS standing out as an exception. With the software merger happening, I wanted to be optimistic, so I waited, hoping that the early beta impressions for OxygenOS 12 were based on incomplete data, that a stable release would land, and I\u2019d see it all come together.\n\nUnfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nWelcome to ColorOS: OnePlus edition\nShort of a detailed code-level software teardown, we can\u2019t really be sure precisely how much of OxygenOS is actually just ColorOS, but even a cursory comparison shows that most of the individual bits and pieces are the same.\nTo start, both OxygenOS and ColorOS now use nearly the same launcher, with almost identical feature sets and system-integrated launcher settings. The Shelf is still there on OxygenOS 12, but if you don\u2019t know how to trigger it, you wouldn\u2019t know. Its settings are no longer in the same place, making it feel bolted-on \u2014 which it probably is. OnePlus did change how the fonts show up in the app drawer (frankly, not a good effect with that weird blurry black shadow), but OxygenOS and ColorOS are clearly using identical launchers, and the similarities don\u2019t end there.\n\nJust different shades of lipstick on the same pig \u2014 this is ColorOS\n\nOf course, many of the other default apps OxygenOS and ColorOS ship with are the same Google apps, which means nothing (if anything, that's a thing to like), but most of the other user-facing bits in places like Settings, for example, are essentially identical as well.\n\nOnePlus and Oppo have a few different graphical assets and some color tweaks, but these are just different shades of lipstick on the same pig \u2014 this is ColorOS. OnePlus has kept features like the Canvas AOD and Shelf, applied its branding for features like Edge Lighting, thrown in a few custom bitmaps and colors, and applied a skin to the notification shade (one of the few major differences, pictured below). But any customer switching from an Oppo phone to a OnePlus phone probably won't be able to tell the difference, while someone coming from an older OnePlus software build will be pretty damn confused.\n\nOxygenOS was also known for its customization options, and those are dwindling now: You can't change the battery icon style in the status bar, you can't set the time in the status bar to show seconds, you can't individually customize icons. OnePlus has even straight-up abandoned features it differentiated with, like quick reply in landscape, among others more niche features \u2014 likely including some we haven't spotted. However, we should point out, App Locker (which hides apps and their notifications behind a PIN-entry screen), and Parallel Apps (which installed multiple versions of the same app) are still both present, just under new names: App Locker's functionality has been merged with Hidden Space and Private Safe, Parallel Apps is called \"App cloner\" now. We had that wrong at first, but OnePlus pointed out to us that the two features are still there.\n\nIt just feels cheap\nSure, things like icons aren\u2019t the same between ColorOS and OxygenOS (I can\u2019t actually tell what OnePlus is using, the icon menu crashes every time I open it), but the Oppofication of OnePlus's once-good Android software is basically complete, and I am not a fan.\n\nMost of our readers are in the US and haven't had a chance to play with too many Chinese phones, but there's a sort of \"flavor\" that most Asian-focused brands apply to their software which is quite different from what we're used to here in the States. It's tough to encapsulate as anything but an outright list of individual things I don't like, but there's a general feeling of busyness, dated aesthetics like gradients or bad transparencies, a lack of flow or uniformity across fonts and layouts, superfluously flashy animations, and 2010-era sound effects \u2014 just bad design, really. It's an imprecise metaphor, but the cumulative effect is like those old Web-1 Flash-based websites we all hated/loved: impressive at a casual glance, but shallow, lacking in taste, janky on the inside, and ignoring workflow or ease of use. In recent years, companies like Oppo have toned that effect down, but the legacy lingers there in bits and pieces, probably because their markets actually like it. But I do not.\n\nOxygenOS used to be a notable exception: A Chinese-based company with a Chinese-made ROM that didn't feel like the others. For a long time, it looked pretty close to stock, and when OnePlus did start making changes to things, It was a step back in consistency and design (if not a partial rip of OneUI). Some of those changes grew on me, others didn't, but it still felt premium and held its own alongside Google's software on the Pixels and Samsung's One UI \u2014 even if I'd have put it at the very end of that list. But this new OxygenOS 12 is every bit as cheap and buggy as it looks, with an airdropped-from-AliExpress vibe that feels like no one at OnePlus even cares anymore.\n\nThe \u201cstable\u201d OxygenOS 12 update\nThis latest update is loaded with bugs. Even in just the last couple of days on my phone, I\u2019ve had to toggle settings back and forth to get my 120Hz display functioning at its full refresh rate again, fix my display density and font size from being way too small, and certain menus straight-up crash. Others have reported that the Phone or Camera apps are disappearing; Wi-Fi MIMO is not working; mobile connectivity is broken, partly broken, or simply reports no signal when you actually have one; and apps in the recents menu can\u2019t be bulk closed, among other issues.\n\nSocial media venues like Twitter and Reddit are universally abuzz with bug reports for the new software. Admittedly, Reddit is filled with antagonism, narcissistic rage, and vitriol on the very best days, but the residents of r/OnePlus are even asking themselves if there are any \"good\" things in OxygenOS 12 at all in the face of both lost features and jank.\n\nAdmittedly, everyone\u2019s experience with OxygenOS 12 seems a little different, but the bugginess itself seems incontrovertible.\n\nImportantly, OnePlus already has a reputation for buggy updates, but usually it's an issue that plagues older devices. Its most recent flagships typically get more attention and a bit more polish compared to older ones, and it's something we had hoped this merger with ColorOS would help fix. The beta testing period was also months long, and OnePlus had time to address issues or delay a release, if need be. A factory reset might also fix some of these problems, but customers shouldn't have to jump through those kinds of hoops. Software and settings are expected to carry over reliably and with a minimum of issues between release versions on Android, especially on thousand-dollar flagships like the OnePlus 9 Pro.\n\nWe've reached out to OnePlus asking about these missing features and if the company plans on pulling the update given the volume of bug reports and the significance of some of the issues, but the company had no information to share with us right now. In the meantime, there's still one good thing about OnePlus phones: They're easy to install third-party ROMs on. Willing customers can even install the latest Android 12 Paranoid Android alpha if they want to live dangerously. That would actually bring you full-circle, too: The Paranoid Android team was partly behind the original OxygenOS \u2014 you know, back when it was good.",
    "Column: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the nation's toughest abortion law. Was it principle or posturing?\nIn 2014, the Republican attorney general of Texas, Greg Abbott, faced Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis in a gubernatorial contest that drew worldwide attention.\n\nDavis became a mega-celebrity \u2014 book contract, magazine covers, speaking tour \u2014 after seizing the Senate floor in Austin and filibustering for nearly 15 hours in support of abortion rights. Tens of millions of dollars flooded her campaign.\n\nStill, Abbott clobbered Davis in one of the biggest Texas landslides in years, extending a long record of futility by hapless Democrats. (Their last statewide win came in 1994, back when Amazon was founded and NBC aired the pilot episode of \u201cFriends.\u201d)\n\n\nAbortion wasn\u2019t the central focus of the race many had expected. Issues like immigration and healthcare and a backlash to the Obama administration were bigger factors in Abbott\u2019s win. At that time, he had yet to sign into law the country\u2019s most stringent antiabortion bill.\n\nMore on that in a moment.\n\nIn a book published during the campaign, Davis revealed she had terminated two pregnancies, including one due to an extreme fetal abnormality. Abbott restated his long-standing position on abortion, opposing the procedure in all instances, save when the life of a mother was endangered.\n\nThen, less than two weeks before election day, the Los Angeles Times published an article on the governor\u2019s race that included Abbott\u2019s stance on abortion. His campaign immediately asked for a correction, saying Abbott had shifted his view and \u201cnow supports a Texas law that allows abortions to take place up to 20 weeks of pregnancy for any reason.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a small footnote to a long-past campaign. But it\u2019s a curious one, given that Abbott earlier this year signed the bill effectively banning abortion in Texas by outlawing it after about six weeks of pregnancy. That\u2019s before many women even know they\u2019re pregnant.\n\nThere are no exceptions for cases involving incest or rape, though Abbott offered his assurance the state would \u201cwork tirelessly to make sure that we eliminate all rapists from the streets of Texas by aggressively going out and arresting them and prosecuting them.\u201d\n\nAs if it were that simple.\n\nSo what happened? Why did Abbott change his position on abortion in the waning days of the 2014 race, publicly adopting a far more permissive stance, then sign into law the country\u2019s tightest restrictions, along with a bounty system that allows private citizens to enforce the near-total ban?\n\nAbbott\u2019s press shop did not respond to requests for comment. So here\u2019s a guess: Running for a third term in 2022, the governor is facing Republican challengers seeking to outflank him in the March 1 primary by running to Abbott\u2019s right.\n\n(Several Democrats are also bidding for governor, including the faded phenom Beto O\u2019Rourke, but they face very long odds of prevailing in November.)\n\n\nAbbott\u2019s most pugnacious opponent, former state Sen. Don Huffines, is using a small part of his personal fortune to brand the governor as a moderate \u2014 by Texas GOP standards that\u2019s Karl Marx territory \u2014 and advertise himself as \u201can actual Republican.\u201d\n\nAbbott is politically conservative. There\u2019s no question about that. But with Huffines dogging him, the governor has moved even further to the right, reversing his position on COVID-19 mandates and prohibiting schools, businesses and local governments from imposing such requirements. He has also, among other moves, echoed Huffines\u2019 call for Texas to build its own wall along the border with Mexico.\n\nAssuming he wins reelection, the 64-year-old Abbott is being talked about as a prospective presidential candidate in 2024, following in the steps of his two most recent Republican predecessors, George W. Bush and Rick Perry. He even has some of the same political advisors who worked for Perry.\n\nAbbott has a reputation in Austin for twisting like a weather vane, depending on the prevailing Republican winds. Given his national ambitions, his flip-flops are worth noting.\n\nIf he\u2019s that malleable on an issue as deeply felt as abortion, what does it say about Abbott\u2019s core beliefs and what he stands for? Apart from winning office, that is.",
    "If you're raising a child on your own, you're in good company. Single-parent families are more common than ever. Know how to manage some of the special challenges single parents experience and what you can do to raise a happy, healthy child.\n\nCommon single-parent challenges\nChild rearing can be difficult under any circumstances. Without a partner, the stakes are higher. As a single parent, you might have sole responsibility for all aspects of day-to-day child care.\n\nBeing a single parent can result in added pressure, stress and fatigue. If you're too tired or distracted to be emotionally supportive or consistently discipline your child, behavioral problems might arise.\n\nSingle-parent families also generally have lower incomes and less access to health care. Juggling work and child care can be financially difficult and socially isolating. You might worry about the lack of a male or female parental role model for your child, too.\n\nPositive strategies\nTo reduce stress in your single-parent family:\n\nShow your love. Remember to praise your child. Give him or her your unconditional love and support. Set aside time each day to play, read or simply sit with your child.\nCreate a routine. Structure \u2014 such as regularly scheduled meals and bedtimes \u2014 helps your child know what to expect.\nFind quality child care. If you need regular child care, look for a qualified caregiver who can provide stimulation in a safe environment. Don't rely on an older child as your only baby sitter. Be careful about asking a new friend or partner to watch your child.\nSet limits. Explain house rules and expectations to your child \u2014 such as speaking respectfully \u2014 and enforce them. Work with other caregivers in your child's life to provide consistent discipline. Consider re-evaluating certain limits, such as your child's screen time, when he or she shows the ability to accept more responsibility.\nDon't feel guilty. Don't blame yourself or spoil your child to make up for being a single parent.\nTake care of yourself. Include physical activity in your daily routine, eat a healthy diet and get plenty of sleep. Arrange time to do activities you enjoy alone or with friends. Give yourself a \"timeout\" by arranging for child care at least a few hours a week.\nLean on others. Work out a carpool schedule with other parents. Join a support group for single parents or seek social services. Call on loved ones, friends and neighbors for help. Faith communities can be helpful resources, too.\nStay positive. It's OK to be honest with your child if you're having a difficult time, but remind him or her that things will get better. Give your child an age-appropriate level of responsibility rather than expecting him or her to behave like a \"little adult.\" Keep your sense of humor when dealing with everyday challenges.\nBe aware that some research has shown that teens in single-parent households have a higher risk of depression and lower self-esteem. Signs and symptoms of depression may include social isolation; feeling sad, alone or unloved; disliking one\u2019s looks; irritability; and a sense of hopelessness. If you see these signs in your child or teen, talk to his or her doctor.\n\nTalking to your child about separation or divorce\nMany single-parent families are the result of divorce or separation. If this is the case in your family, talk to your child about the changes you're facing. Listen to your child's feelings and try to answer his or her questions honestly \u2014 avoiding unnecessary details or negativity about the other parent. Remind your child that he or she did nothing to cause the divorce or separation and that you'll always love him or her.\n\nA counselor might be able to help you and your child talk about problems, fears or concerns. Try to regularly communicate with your child's other parent about your child's care and well-being to help him or her adapt. Children who fare best in divorce have parents who continue to communicate on co-parenting issues, placing their children's needs above their own desire to avoid the ex-spouse.\n\nSingle parenting and dating\nIf you're dating, consider the impact your new romantic partner will have on your child. Look for a partner who will treat both you and your child with respect. Consider waiting until you've established a solid relationship with someone before introducing him or her to your child.\n\nWhen you're ready to make the introduction, explain to your child some of your new partner's positive qualities. Don't expect your new partner and your child to become close immediately, however. Give them time to get to know each other, and be clear that the new partner isn't trying to replace the other parent.\n\nMale and female role models\nIf your child's other parent isn't involved in his or her life, you might worry about the lack of a male or female parental role model in your child's life. To send positive messages about the opposite sex:\n\nLook for opportunities to be positive. Point out accomplishments or positive characteristics of members of the opposite sex in your family, the community or even the media. Avoid making broad, negative statements about the opposite sex.\nContradict negative stereotypes about the opposite sex. Share an example of a member of the opposite sex who doesn't fit the stereotype.\nInclude in your life members of the opposite sex who aren't romantic partners. Seek out positive relationships with responsible members of the opposite sex who might serve as role models for your child. Show your child that it's possible to have long-term, positive relationships with members of the opposite sex.\nBeing a single parent can be a challenging but rewarding experience. By showing your child love and respect, talking honestly and staying positive, you can lessen your stress and help your child thrive.",
    "Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nOne day her mother said to her, \"Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don't forget to say, good-morning, and don't peep into every corner before you do it.\"\n\nI will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.\n\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n\n\"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood,\" said he.\n\n\"Thank you kindly, wolf.\"\n\n\"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\n\n\"To my grandmother's.\"\n\n\"What have you got in your apron?\"\n\n\"Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.\"\n\n\"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\"\n\n\"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it,\" replied Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThe wolf thought to himself, \"What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both.\" So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, \"see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry.\"\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked at the door.\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\n\"Little Red Riding Hood,\" replied the wolf. \"She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door.\"\n\n\"Lift the latch,\" called out the grandmother, \"I am too weak, and cannot get up.\"\n\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother's bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.\n\nShe called out, \"Good morning,\" but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n\n\"Oh, grandmother,\" she said, \"what big ears you have.\"\n\n\"The better to hear you with, my child,\" was the reply.\n\n\"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\" she said.\n\n\"The better to see you with, my dear.\"\n\n\"But, grandmother, what large hands you have.\"\n\n\"The better to hug you with.\"\n\n\"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\"\n\n\"The better to eat you with.\"\n\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how the old woman is snoring. I must just see if she wants anything.\n\nSo he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \"Do I find you here, you old sinner,\" said he. \"I have long sought you.\"\n\nThen just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.\n\nWhen he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, \"Ah, how frightened I have been. How dark it was inside the wolf.\"\n\nAnd after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf's belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.\n\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf's skin and went home with it. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Little Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived, but Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\n\nIt is also related that once when Little Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. Little Red Riding Hood, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten her up. \"Well,\" said the grandmother, \"we will shut the door, that he may not come in.\"\n\nSoon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried, \"open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Hood, and am bringing you some cakes.\"\n\nBut they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, intending to wait until Little Red Riding Hood went home in the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the child, take the pail, Little Red Riding Hood. I made some sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough. Little Red Riding Hood carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned. But Little Red Riding Hood went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.\n",
    "Grey area' SSH& contracts cause problems for internationals - Vox magazine\nWith more than 6.000 renters, SSH& plays a big role in the Nijmegen housing market. But every year, the time-restricted contracts the student housing cooperation is working with contribute to a temporary clogging of the housing market. One consequence: students who are left without a roof over their head after their contract expires.\n\nSSH& is, with more than 6.000 renters, the largest housing cooperation in Nijmegen. And with renting to everyone from bachelor student to PhD candidate, degree-seeking or on exchange, in Nijmegen and Arnhem, the company contributes massively to affordable housing for students.\n\nShort-stay contract\nSSH& doesn\u2019t only work with regular rental contracts. Short-stay contracts are a form of temporal contracts for which different rules apply. For instance, the contracts cannot be cancelled on a monthly basis, but only at the end of the contract and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 halfway through. For SSH& short-stay contracts, that means in January or August. Students are also not allowed to sublet the room. In 2020, SSH& housed 1.370 students with short-stay contracts.\n\nMost students renting with SSH& are able to live in their room or apartment until graduation. But that is not the case for everyone. The reason is so-called short-stay contracts that SSH& is working with, used to rent out rooms for a limited amount of time, often six months or a year. Unlike regular contracts, however, short-stay contracts are not protected under Dutch rental law.\n\nOne result of that is that short-stay contracts cannot be cancelled on a monthly basis. This gives rise to two issues. On the one hand, students can run into (financial) problems when looking for a new room. On the other, the contracts contribute to a clogging of the housing market by increasing the number of students looking for a new place at the same time.\n\nInternational students\nAccording to Marie-Sophie Simon (asap), this might not be a problem for exchange students for whom the contracts are primarily intended. But for degree-seeking international students (receiving the same contracts during their first year when they still receive help in finding housing from the university, ed.), this can be an issue. \u2018Those contracts can only be quit two months before the half-year mark\u2019, explains Simon. \u2018So, if you move in in August, you ought to know in November whether you can move to a private long-term place in January. And that is basically impossible.\u2019\n\nThe contracts are not necessarily a bad thing says Roel Veenstra (AKKUraatd): \u2018I\u2019m happy that SSH& at least wants to help students by offering them one-year contracts.\u2019 However, both party representatives agree, the inability to terminate early feeds into a bigger issue: by the time the one-year contracts run out in summer, new Dutch and international students are also looking for rooms. \u2018So, within a short timeframe, you have three really big incoming student groups that want to find housing,\u2019 explains Veenstra. Contributing, in the end, to a clogging of the housing market.\n\n\u2018You ought to know in November whether you can move to a new place in January \u2013 and that is basically impossible\u2019\n\nFollowing SSH& manager of strategy and living, Marco Schoofs, SSH& is not intending to change their contract policy for degree-seeking international students in the near future. \u2018The short-stay contracts are meant for a period of half a year or a year. In that period, a student who wants to stay longer in Nijmegen can seek for a place to live on their own.\u2019\n\nSomething that, according to both Veenstra and Simon, is not always that straight-forward, often resulting in students having to pay double-rent until their short-stay contract runs out. \u2018A student can\u2019t afford that\u2019, Simon explains. As a consequence, students are often forced to wait until their contract expires before they can search for new housing. Something Simon has experienced herself: \u2018I was kicked-out of my SSH& room in August and ended up homeless for five weeks.\u2019\n\nGrey area\nAccording to Jaap Dammingh, professor at the law faculty and expert in Dutch rental law, while those short-stay contracts are legal, they are also in a grey area. \u2018Tenants are protected quite strongly under the Dutch rental law, but that doesn\u2019t apply to contracts for short-term use. But it is not necessarily said that a judge would rule the same way.\u2019\n\n\u2018Tenants are protected quite strongly under the Dutch rental law, but that doesn\u2019t apply to contracts for short-term use\u2019\n\nDammingh, however, negates a possible change in the near future. \u2018For now, the important thing for international students when signing a contract for short-term use is that they are aware that there is a high likelihood that they will not be able to terminate it before the ending date.\u2019\n\nIt is still unclear to which degree short-stay contracts will take a central point on AKKUraatd\u2019s agenda in the future. \u2018But I would find it illogical if we don\u2019t follow up on this\u2019, according to Veenstra. According to Simon, an awareness programme about short-stay contracts is beyond the political scope of asap, but, together with AKKUraatd, the party has engaged in conversations with the Works Council and the Executive Board. \u2018It turns out\u2019, so Simon, \u2018they were apparently not even aware of the fact that international students get these kinds of contracts.\u2019",

    "If you are going to be in the Netherlands for a while, it\u2019s a good idea to get a Dutch mobile phone - it will surely save you some money. But what's the best option for you? Will you go for a Sim Only deal or is a phone contract the way to go?\n\nWhether you have just arrived in the Netherlands, or you have been living here for a while and just looking to get a new smartphone, you have two options: You can buy a phone yourself and get a Sim Only subscription with the provider of your choice, or you can choose a provider and make use of their mobile phone contracts. Both options have pros and cons. Is a smartphone contract the best option for you? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nSo, how does it work exactly, a smartphone contract in the Netherlands?\nWhen you opt for a smartphone contract, you get a phone from your provider. You pay for your phone per month during your contract period, on top of your standard sim costs. Generally, your contract period lasts from one to two years. During this period, you can increase the amount of data and the number of minutes of your plan but can't decrease them.\n\nA smartphone contract: the pros\nThinking about getting a smartphone contract? Here are the pros!\n\nPay per month\nIf you are looking to buy a new smartphone and you are on a budget, getting a smartphone contract is ideal. This way, you don\u2019t have to pay a large amount of money in one go to get the phone you want because, let\u2019s face it, smartphones are not exactly cheap. At least not if you really want the latest iPhone, for instance. Many people simply can\u2019t afford to put down 1.000 euros for a phone without saving for a while.\n\nAlways the latest smartphone\nAlso, if having the latest smartphone is important to you, a smartphone contract is the way to go. After all, when you have a pay monthly contract, you can get a new phone every one to two years, depending on the length of your phone contract.\n\nA smartphone contract: the cons\nOf course, there are also a few cons when it comes to getting a smartphone contract.\n\nLess flexibility and freedom\nWhen you have a phone contract, you are \u201cstuck\u201d with it for one to two years. If you want to end your contract before this time, you will have to pay for your remaining months. So, make sure you choose a deal that fits your needs.\n\nBKR registration\nThe Dutch government considers smartphone contracts to be a loan. What this means is you'll have to carry out a mandatory BKR registration and income test. BKR stands for Bureau Krediet Registratie (Credit Registration Office), and this office keeps track of any loans you may have taken out. This could result in a lower maximum mortgage if you are looking to buy a house, for example. If you want to prevent this, make sure your device contribution is a maximum of 10 euros per month with a two-year contract, or a maximum of 20 euros per month with a one-year contract.\n\nWhat\u2019s best for you?\nWhat\u2019s best for you - Sim Only or a smartphone contract - is ultimately up to you! Some questions you may want to consider:\n\nHow long will you be in the Netherlands for?\nHow important is having the latest smartphone for you?\nCan you pay for a smartphone in one go or would pay-per-month suit your budget better?\nDo you have any other loans (BKR registration)?",
    "Can the Netherlands look forward to a white Christmas this year?\n\nThe count down to Christmas has officially begun! Sinterklaas has been and gone, and the school holidays are only a few short weeks away. As the holiday stress begins to set in for many, excitement for the imminent festivities is also in the air. The question on everybody\u2019s lips: will the Netherlands have a white Christmas this year?\n\nSome optimistic about a white Christmas in the Netherlands \nEvery year, people up and down the country ask exactly the same thing, wondering whether the Netherlands will ever enjoy a properly snowy Christmas. Sadly, the Dutch weather rarely cooperates (instead offering up a white February...or a white March). What do the experts say we should expect this Christmas?\n\nAt the beginning of December, meteorologist Reinout van den Born told radio station BNR that the Netherlands should prepare for a very cold winter with lots of snow and plenty of ice: \u201cIf you look at winter from a winter perspective, the run-up to winter has never been more promising than this year, a white Christmas could very well be the case.\u201d\n\nWeather over Christmas remains unclear\nSince then, some parts of the Netherlands have already been treated to a fairly light dusting of snow, and while WeerOnline expects that temperatures should drop in time for Christmas, reducing the chance of heavy rainfall or storms, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll be building a snowman with the family on Christmas morning. \u201cCalmer weather can bring frost at the end of December, but also chilly and grey weather with a few degrees above zero,\u201d WeerOnline writes. \n\nSimilarly to WeerOnline, the experts over at WeerPlaza say the conditions over the holidays are looking fairly changeable at the moment. An area of high pressure is expected somewhere over Central Europe in the run-up to Christmas, and depending on its precise location, it could either bring cold wintery conditions, or milder temperatures. \n\nTo sum up: Will the Netherlands close off 2021 with a white Christmas? It seems the experts aren\u2019t too sure yet. So no matter what weather you\u2019re hoping for this festive season, be sure to keep your fingers crossed!",
    "A Midsummer Night's Dream\nTL;DR: People get lost in the woods. Puck manipulates their romantic affections and (in one case) anatomical head-shape. They put on a play.\n\nFour Athenians run away to the forest only to have Puck the fairy make both of the boys fall in love with the same girl. The four run through the forest pursuing each other while Puck helps his master play a trick on the fairy queen. In the end, Puck reverses the magic, and the two couples reconcile and marry.\n\nAct I\nAs Duke Theseus prepares for his marriage to Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, he is interrupted by a courtier, Egeus. Egeus asks for the Duke to intervene in a dispute. His daughter, Hermia, will not agree to marry Demetrius (whom Egeus has chosen for her) because she loves a gentleman named Lysander. The Duke asks Hermia to be obedient to her father. He offers her one of two options: she must either die or accept a celibate life as a nun in Diana's temple. \n\nNaturally upset with the offer, Lysander and Hermia plan to elope and share their secret with Helena, Hermia's friend. Helena is desperately in love with Demetrius, who seems to have abandoned her in favour of Hermia. At night, Lysander and Hermia escape from Athens; but they soon lose their way in the woods. After Helena tells him of their intention to defy the law, Demetrius decides to follow the lovers into the woods. In turn, Helena follows Demetrius in the hope that he will give up on Hermia and choose her instead.  \n\nMeanwhile, a group of working men are preparing a play of the tragic love-story of Pyramus and Thisbe to present before the Duke Theseus on his wedding day. Nick Bottom, the weaver, is to play the lover Pyramus, while Flute, the bellows-mender, begrudgingly agrees to play Thisbe. \n\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.\n\n\nAct II\nNearby, Oberon - King of the Fairies\u2014has recently quarrelled with his queen, Titania. She acquired a magical child from one of her waiting women, and now refuses to hand him over to Oberon to use as a page. Oberon begins to plot a way to get revenge on Titania for her disobedience. He sends his fairy servant, Puck, to fetch a purple flower with juice that makes people fall in love with the next creature they see.  \n\nAfterwards, Oberon overhears Helena and Demetrius arguing in the forest. Oberon hears Demetrius mistreat Helena and tells Puck to anoint 'the Athenian', so Demetrius will fall in love with the first person that he sees. Puck mistakes the Athenian and puts the flower juice on the eyes of the sleeping Lysander. When he is woken by Helena, he immediately falls in love with her and rejects Hermia. When Demetrius rests, Oberon puts magic juice on his eyes, which makes him fall in love with Helena as well. \n\nAct III \nThe workers' rehearsals in the wood are overheard by Puck, who plays a trick on them by giving Bottom an ass's head. After frightening the others away, Bottom is lured towards the sleeping Titania whom Oberon has anointed with Puck's magic flower juice. On waking, the fairy queen falls in love with the ass and entertains him with her fairies.  \n\nThe course of true love never did run smooth.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Demetrius and Lysander, still under the spell of the flower juice, pursue Helena. Hermia is jealous and confused about the lack of attention paid to her. Oberon and Puck watch the chaos, and Oberon commands Puck to put it right again. The lovers' arguments have tired them all out as they have chased one another through the woods. Puck eventually distracts the two men from their pursuit of Helena by impersonating their voices, and they get lost in the woods. The four lovers fall asleep, exhausted. Puck places restorative juice on Lysander's eyes.\n\nAct IV\n\nAfter an afternoon of being pampered by Titania's fairies, Bottom falls asleep beside her. Oberon restores Titania's sight and wakes her (thank goodness). After expressing her dismay at the sight of Bottom, she reconciles with Oberon, and she ends up giving him the little Indian prince for his page. Bottom's ass head is removed, and he returns to the city to rejoin his friends as they prepare to perform their play. The lovers are woken by Theseus and Hippolyta's hunting party. Lysander sees Hermia and falls in love with her once again. \n\nAct V\nHappily reunited (Lysander with Hermia and Demetrius with Helena), they agree to share the Duke's wedding day. The play of 'Pyramus and Thisbe' is presented before the wedding guests. As the three couples retire to bed, Puck and the fairies return to bless the palace and its people.",
    "A Midsummer Night's Dream takes place in Athens. Theseus, the Duke of Athens, is planning his marriage with Hippolyta, and as a result he is a planning a large festival. Egeus enters, followed by his daughter Hermia, her beloved Lysander, and her suitor Demetrius. Egeus tells Theseus that Hermia refuses to marry Demetrius, wanting instead to marry Lysander. He asks for the right to punish Hermia with death if she refuses to obey.\n\nTheseus agrees that Hermia's duty is to obey her father, and threatens her with either entering a nunnery or marrying the man her father chooses. Lysander protests, but is overruled by the law. He and Hermia than decide to flee by night into the woods surrounding Athens, where they can escape the law and get married. They tell their plan to Helena, a girl who is madly in love with Demetrius. Hoping to gain favor with Demetrius, Helena decides to tell him about the plan.\n\nSome local artisans and workmen have decided to perform a play for Theseus as a way to celebrate his wedding. They choose Pyramus and Thisbe for their play, and meet to assign the roles. Nick Bottom gets the role of Pyramus, and Flute takes the part of Thisbe. They agree to meet the next night in the woods to rehearse the play.\n\nRobin Goodfellow, a puck, meets a fairy who serves Queen Titania. He tells the fairy that his King Oberon is in the woods, and that Titania should avoid Oberon because they will quarrel again. However, Titania and Oberon soon arrive and begin arguing about a young boy Titania has stolen and is caring for. Oberon demands that she give him the boy, but she refuses.\n\nOberon decides to play a trick on Titania and put some pansy juice on her eyes. The magical juice will make her fall in love with first person she sees upon waking up. Soon after Puck is sent away to fetch the juice, Oberon overhears Demetrius and Helena in the woods.\n\nDemetrius deserts Helena in the forest, leaving her alone. Oberon decides that he will change this situation, and commands Robin to put the juice onto Demetrius's eyes when he is sleeping. He then finds Titania and drops the juice onto her eyelids. Robin goes to find Demetrius, but instead comes across Lysander and accidentally uses the juice on him.\n\nBy accident Helena comes across Lysander and wakes him up. He immediately falls in love with her and starts to chase her through the woods. Together they arrive where Oberon is watching, and he realizes the mistake. Oberon then puts the pansy juice onto Demetrius's eyelids, who upon waking up also falls in love with Helena. She thinks that the two men are trying to torment her for being in love with Demetrius, and becomes furious at their protestations of love.\n\nThe workmen arrive in the woods and start to practice their play. They constantly ruin the lines of the play and mispronounce the words. Out of fear of censorship, they decide to make the play less realistic. Therefore the lion is supposed to announce that he is not a lion, but only a common man. Bottom also feels obliged to tell the audience that he is not really going to die, but will only pretend to do so. Puck, watching this silly scene, catches Bottom alone and puts an asses head on him. When Bottom returns to his troupe, they run away out of fear. Bottom then comes across Titania, and succeeds in waking her up. She falls in love with him due to the juice on her eyes, and takes him with her.\n\nLysander and Demetrius prepare to fight one another for Helena. Puck intervenes and leads them through the woods in circles until they collapse onto the ground in exhaustion. He then brings the two women to same area and puts them to sleep as well.\n\nOberon finds Titania and releases her from the spell. He then tells the audience that Bottom will think is all a dream when he wakes up. He further releases Lysander from the spell. Theseus arrives with a hunting party and finds the lovers stretched out on the ground. He orders the hunting horns blown in order to wake them up.\n\nThe lovers explain why they are in the woods, at which point Egeus demands that he be allowed to exercise the law on Hermia. However, Demetrius intervenes and tells them that he no longer loves Hermia, but rather only loves Helena. Theseus decides to overbear Egeus and let the lovers get married that day with him. Together they return to Athens.\n\nBottom wakes up and thinks that he has dreamed the entire episode. He swiftly returns to Athens where he meets his friends. Together they head over to Theseus's palace. Theseus looks over the list of possible entertainment for that evening and settles on the play of Pyramus and Thisbe. Bottom and the rest of his company perform the play, after which everyone retires to bed.\n\nPuck arrives and starts to sweep the house clean. Oberon and Titania briefly bless the couples and their future children. After they leave Puck asks the audience to forgive the actors if they were offended. He then tells the audience that if anyone disliked the play, they should imagine that it was only a dream.",
    "Paul, Stilgar, and Gurney observe the enormous temporary structure where the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV is staying on Arrakis. Everything is in place, though Gurney and Stilgar each have doubts that Paul soothes. They release the two Sardaukar they captured; in response, the Emperor raises the CHOAM Company flag, signaling that he doesn\u2019t care who wins, Atreides or Harkonnen. An enormous storm hits, and the battle begins. Things go well for Paul, but they receive a garbled message that Paul understands: Sietch Tabr was raided; his son, Leto II, is dead; and Alia is held hostage. Paul feels emptied, diseased\u2014and he also feels an \"old-man wisdom\" chuckle and rub its hands within him. He thinks: How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe Baron Harkonnen is in an audience chamber with the Emperor himself. The Emperor has brought his entire retinue\u2014from Sardaukar to hairdressers and poets\u2014along with the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohaim, the Emperor\u2019s Truthsayer. The Emperor is angry that he has been roped into this expensive and \u201cstupid affair.\u201d The Emperor reveals that he raided the southern desert and took Alia captive, at great personal cost. Alia says she allowed herself to be captured, and she inserts herself in the Reverend Mother\u2019s mind, frightening her.\n\nAs Alia predicts, the Emperor\u2019s stronghold is soon under attack. The Baron grabs Alia, but she stabs him with a dark needle she calls \u201cthe Atreides gom jabbar,\u201d killing him. The battle is chaotic as the stronghold is breached; Sardaukar are awed to see Fremen riding sandworms into battle. The Emperor is taken safely to his ship with the Reverend Mother, his daughter Princess Irulan, and two Guild agents. The Guild agents say they don\u2019t know how the battle will go\u2014but that means Muad\u2019Dib can\u2019t know, either. The Reverend Mother advises the Emperor to summon Count Fenring.\n\nChapter 11\n\nPaul-Muad\u2019Dib enters the governor\u2019s mansion in Arrakeen on the evening of his victory. Alia tells Paul\u2014through a medium he doesn't understand, but of which he is aware\u2014that she has killed their grandfather, Baron Harkonnen. Rabban is also dead; Paul, seeming strange in a way that worries Jessica, sends word to the Emperor that he\u2019s welcome to come down to Arrakis with Paul\u2019s protection.\n\nThe Emperor arrives, along with Princess Irulan, Guild agents, the Reverend Mother, Thufir Hawat, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, and Count Fenring (who Paul realizes he\u2019s never seen along any time-line\u2014just like he\u2019s never seen his own moment of death). Hawat chooses to die in Paul\u2019s arms from the Harkonnen poison rather than assassinate Paul as he was told to do. Paul threatens the Guild agents with the complete destruction of all spice, and they obey his commands. He reveals that the Bene Gesserit have been controlling bloodlines for 90 generations and tells the Reverend Mother that she has no control over him. Feyd-Rautha invokes the rules of kanly, which was declared by Duke Leto between Harkonnen and Atreides, and Paul agrees to fight him one-on-one; the Emperor allows Feyd to fight with his own personal blade. The Reverend Mother is concerned that if both of the young men die here, they will be survived only by Feyd\u2019s infant bastard daughter and Alia.\n\nFeyd-Rautha and Paul-Muad\u2019Dib fight. Paul is silent, and Feyd is boastful, with a secret poison dart in his waistband. Paul uses his powers to atomically alter the soporific on the Emperor\u2019s blade, which had been designed to slow him down. Even pinned beneath the poison dart, Paul refuses to say a secret word that will cause Feyd's muscles to freeze (like the one Feyd used on the slave-gladiator on his 17th birthday). Paul gains the upper hand and stabs Feyd under the jaw and through the head, killing him.\n\nThe Emperor commands Count Fenring to kill Paul, but the Count says no. Paul realizes he can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d the Count in the past or future because Count Fenring was almost the Kwisatz Haderach himself, but was born a eunuch; Paul feels brotherhood for the first time in his life. The Emperor is furious. Muad\u2019Dib (not Paul, as that would break the Atreides promise to keep the Emperor safe) sentences the Emperor to live on Salusa Secundus, which Paul intends to turn into a paradise planet\u2014just like Arrakis, which will also maintain some of its desert for spice and for training men. The Emperor, defeated, agrees at his daughter\u2019s urging: Paul will marry Irulan and be next in line for the Imperial Throne.\n\nPaul asks Jessica and Chani to negotiate the terms for him. He wants the Emperor\u2019s entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry; Gurney Halleck will gain Caladan, and every surviving Atreides man will be rewarded. The Fremen will be rewarded by Muad\u2019Dib, not Paul. Jessica will go to Caladan for \u201cpeace and stillness,\u201d as she requests. Chani begs Paul to give her nothing, and he promises her that she\u2019ll need nothing\u2014she\u2019ll have his entire heart, and Princess Irulan won\u2019t ever get a child or a touch or a soft look from him. Jessica whispers to Chani to trust Paul\u2014Irulan might have the title, but concubines like Jessica and Chani will be remembered by history as wives.\n\nAnalysis\n\nPaul is around 18 years old at the end of Dune, but during the final battle he learns that he has lost his son, Leto II. Like the death of his father, this grief leaves Paul feeling \"emptied,\" but with the addition of what's portrayed as a cunning, almost comedic, explicitly elderly mischief, or even glee. His thought\u2014How little the universe knows about the nature of real cruelty!\u2014recalls Liet-Kynes's dying thought, in which he decides that the nature of the universe is dominated by principles of accident and error. Kynes's chapter ends: \"Even the hawks could appreciate these facts.\" If the universe operates on the principles of accident and error, and the universe doesn't know the nature of real cruelty, then it can be deduced that cruelty is intentional, not accidental, not an error\u2014maybe cruelty is human.\n\nFrank Herbert intentionally left loose ends so that readers would reread Dune and be interested in its sequels. Some of these are obvious, like the impending jihad, the visions Paul has of his own stabbed corpse, and what Paul will do as Emperor, not just Duke Atreides. Viewed on its own, Dune almost completes a hero's journey, with Paul returning home (well, Arrakeen, anyway), uniquely powerful, triumphant over the Evil One(s). However, the final chapter, and especially the final few pages, emphasize how unheroic Paul's triumph is. If anything, it's a bureaucratic nightmare of logistics and contracts. Paul heroically kills Feyd-Rautha, but talk turns quickly to marriage arrangements and business holdings, not the fate of the universe.",
    "A Thousand Splendid Suns Summary and Analysis of Chapters 36- 40\nBuy Study Guide\nThe morning of the planned runaway, Laila is sure that Rasheed must be aware of the plan. However, he leaves for work just as he does every other day, without mentioning anything to Mariam or Laila. The women pack up Aziza and take a taxi to the bus station. On the way, Laila noticd the destruction that had affected Kabul during recent fighting.\n\nOnce they arrive at the station, Laila plans to find a man to help her buy her bus tickets and act as her relative. Ever since the Mujahideen takeover two years earlier, women were forbidden to travel without a male relative, as per Shari\u2019a, strict Islamic law. These laws also required women to cover themselves, and punished adultery with death. Laila and Mariam also looked ahead to their plan\u2019s second most risky element, crossing into Pakistan, a nation so filled with Afghan refugees that it had to begin turning people away.\n\nLaila and Mariam choose a manto pose as a relative. He agrees to help them buy their tickets, after Laila explains that she was a widow with her mother and daughter. The man buys their tickets, and tells Laila that he would say they were his cousins if any guards questioned them.\n\nLaila thanks Mariam for her participation in the escape, and she confesses that she can\u2019t do it without her. Laila becomes hopeful and strong. The family gets in line to board the bus with their posed male relative. However, after he enters the bus himself, the man whispers something to the militiamen guarding the bus. Laila, Mariam, and Aziza are told to step aside. The three of them are taken to the police station, despite Laila\u2019s protests.\n\nLaila is questioned by an officer, who ultimately determins that her story about visiting her uncle in Pakistan is false. The officer reveals that the escape that Laila attempts is not uncommon among Afghan women. Laila pleads with the officer not to send them back to a house in which they would be endangered, but the officer refuses to interfere with \u201cprivate family matters.\u201d\n\nThe police officers drops Laila, Mariam, and Aziza off at Rasheed\u2019s house. Rasheed is enraged, and Laila attempts to explain to Rasheed that Mariam is innocent. After punching Laila, Rasheed draggs her with Aziza into a bedroom and locks the door. Rasheed then proceeds to beat Mariam, and locks her in a toolshed. Rasheed then nails boards across the window of the room in which he has thrown Laila and Aziza, leaving them in complete darkness.\n\nLocked in the room, Aziza cries for milk, but Rasheed does not give them any food or water. Aziza quickly becomes dehydrated. Laila dreams that they found Tariq, but that he could not hear her. After three days, Rasheed opens the door of the room. He threatened that if she attempt such an act again, he would kill Mariam first, then Aziza, and then would kill Laila after making her watch the murders of the other two.\n\nThe novel now jumps ahead two and a half years, to September 27, 1996, the day of the Taliban\u2019s arrival to Afghanistan. The Taliban are a group of young Pashtuns, many of which grew up as refugees. They follow Mullah Omar, a man of which the characters in the book know very little. Rasheed looks to the Taliban for hope to \u201cclean up this place\u201d.\n\nSince Laila and Mariam\u2019s attempted escape, Rasheed has begun to conceive of the two of them as one being that he detests. He rarely directs his speech towards the women. Rasheed, Laila, Mariam, and Aziza go out to greet the Taliban. Many Afghans they passed seemed hopeful as well. Along their trip, the family learns that Massoud has withdrawn from Kabul. The people of Kabul celebrate the Taliban\u2019s arrival.\n\nThe main spectacle of the Taliban\u2019s entrance is a scene in which a Talib stands with a megaphone next to two dead Soviet sympathizers hanging from traffic posts. The Talib proclaims that the men were infidels and their punishment reflects what will come to those who commit crimes against Islam. Rasheed seems pleased by this announcement.\n\nThe next day, the people of Kabul receive a message that lists the laws enacted by the Taliban. These new statutes require strict adherence to Islamic law. For the men, this includes growing beards and wearing turbans. Women are forbidden from leaving the house unaccompanied, showing their faces, or speaking without being spoken to first. The punishment for women who laugh in public or neglect to wear a burqa is a beating by the Taliban. All schools for girls are immediately shut down, and women are forbidden from working.\n\nLaila is in disbelief about the forced house arrest of women that the Taliban enforced, yet Rasheed assures her that the rest of Afghanistan had been following these practices already. Laila is thankful that her father could not see what the Taliban had done to their country. Universities and museums are ravaged, and artifacts and books are destroyed. Talibs patrol the streets, beating people for violations of the strict laws. Cinemas are ransacked and the graves of entertainers are terrorized. Mariam wonders what happened to her father and his cinema.\n\nRasheed is tolerant of the Taliban takeover, and even seemed satisfied by some of their twisted law enforcement practices. He reveals that he notices that Aziza\u2019s eye color does not match his or Laila\u2019s. He also threatens Laila, telling her that he can go to the Taliban if he chooses to explain that he suspects he is not Aziza\u2019s father. Laila calls Rasheed despicable, and Rasheed assures her that he is the only thing keeping Laila and her daughter off the streets. Laila knows that he is right.\n\nLaila soon realizes that she is pregnant again. She prepares to abort her unborn child, using a bicycle spoke. She does not think she will have the capability to love Rasheed\u2019s child as she does Tariq\u2019s. However, while sitting on the bathroom floor, she could not go through with the abortion. She realizes that her battle with Rasheed does not involve the baby, and that killing the baby would be another murder of an innocent, when so much killing has been going on around her.\n\nOn the day that Laila goes into labor with her second child, she and her family are forced to travel around Kabul due to the Taliban\u2019s shifting of the hospital system: separating men and women into separate hospitals. The family is directed to Rabia Balkhi hospital, which they learn does not have clean water, medications, or even electricity.\n\nWhen they arrive at the hospital, the waiting room is packed by women and their families. Mariam makes an effort to assure Laila that she will be seen by a doctor, fighting through the crowd in the waiting room. In the process, Mariam begins to realize the sacrifices made by a mother, and she reflects on her betrayal of Nana. Mariam learns that there are only two doctors working at the hospital, and a nurse instructs her to take a walk with Laila and to wait.\n\nWhen Laila is finally seen by a doctor, the delivery room is completely open, so that all of the women delivering can see one another. The doctor wears a long burqa, and she tells Laila that she needs an immediate caesarian section. However, the doctor whispers to Mariam that there is no anesthesia available for the procedure. Despite Mariam\u2019s protests, the doctor insists that the hospital has very little medical equipment in general. Mariam attempts to get the name of th anesthesia so that she could go get it for Laila, but Laila just asks the doctor to \u201ccut me open and give me my baby.\u201d The doctor goes ahead with the procedure and Mariam is amazed by how long Laila is able to go without screaming.\n\nIn the Fall of 1998, a drought falls over Afghanistan. Mariam has the idea to dig a hole in the backyard to find a spring. Mariam is now forty, and she is showing signs of her age. Zalmai, Laila\u2019s son, is now two years old. He is a sweet child when alone with Laila, but when with Rasheed, Zalmai became more brash, which Rasheed condones.\n\nRasheed began to spend excessive amounts of money on Zalmai, not reusing any of Aziza\u2019s old toys or diapers. Rasheed informs the family that despite slow business, he is able to borrow the money for Zalmai\u2019s things from his friends. He insists that their financial situation will turn around soon. Rasheed is often annoyed if Laila speaks to the two of them when they are together, and he is hurt if Zalmai reaches for Laila when he is present.\n\nThe culminating purchase of Rasheed\u2019s spending spree for Zalmai is a television and a VCR. These were illegal according to the Taliban, but Rasheed is able to buy them in an underground market. Rasheed proclaims the TV to be Zalmai\u2019s alone.\n\nIn the meantime, Aziza had grown up to be a very mature and thoughtful child, despite her young age. She had taken on great responsibility in helping to take care of Zalmai. Rasheed decides that he wants Aziza to beg on the streets, to help cover the money that he had borrowed for Zalmai\u2019s things. Laila protests against this decision and Rasheed slaps her in response. Laila punches Rasheed in retaliation. Rasheed leaves the room, and he returns to put the barrel of his gun in Laila\u2019s mouth. But he does not shoot.\n\nMariam and Laila bury \u201cZalmai\u2019s TV\u201d in the backyard. While they dig, Laila daydreams that she and Mariam are not burying the TV, but rather, they are burying Aziza. In the dream, Aziza is begging for the women to let her out of the hole, to stop covering her with dirt. Laila keeps reassuring Aziza that this is only a temporary situation, and then she and Mariam will dig her out of the hole.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nWhen the day comes for Laila and Mariam\u2019s escape with Aziza, the tone is hopeful, anticipatory. Once Laila finds a man to buy her the tickets, she reflects on how far she has come and takes pride in her strength. Yet, as we have seen repeatedly in the novel, this hope is quickly followed by a surge of despair, as Laila and Mariam are arrested, and soon suffer brutal consequences at the hands of Rasheed.\n\nIronically, the people of Afghanistan welcome the Taliban as a force that will change Afghanistan\u2019s chaotic and impoverished state. However, the Afghan people do not seem to truly understand what the reign of the Taliban really will mean to their day to day lives. Once their strict laws are announced to the people, it seems as if the idyllic hope of the Afghan people once again dies. However, Rasheed\u2019s affinity for the Taliban further allows readers to see insight into his sexist attitudes, and how he can use the Taliban reign to gain even more power within his household.\n\nLaila\u2019s inner turmoil about whether or not to abort her unborn child provides insight into the multiple layers of her character, and how her character has changed since she has become hardened by Rasheed. Prior to Rasheed\u2019s harsh treatment of her, Laila could not have conceived of abortion for she was immensely protective of life and her own maternal ambitions. However, she has become so hateful and angry over the severe abuse from Rasheed that she battles herself over whether or not she could ever properly raise a child fathered by him. Ultimately, the mothering, caring side of Laila overwhelms the hateful side, and the baby is saved.\n\nLaila\u2019s delivery of Zalmai adds two levels of insight to the novel. First of all, the struggle that the family endures just to see a doctor shows how far the Taliban have gone to subjugate women. The Taliban have denied women even the most basic right, that of healthcare. The only women\u2019s hospital in the city is in poor conditions, and is insufficiently equipped. Additionally, the scene depicts the sacrifices made by a mother. By allowing the operation to go forward without anesthesia, Laila subjects herself to excruciating pain and severe risk. Yet, she puts her child before herself, and does her best to tolerate the pain at hand.\n\nLaila\u2019s vision of Aziza down a hole in place of Zalmai\u2019s television symbolizes how Aziza is suffering the consequences for Rasheed\u2019s excessive spending on his son. For example, due to the family\u2019s poor financial state, Rasheed is willing to put forth Aziza as a beggar. Additionally, this vision of Laila reassuring Aziza that it is a temporary arrangement and Aziza begging her not to go through with it foreshadows how Aziza will be left in an orphanage later in the novel. Laila is rendered helpless in the situation, except to do her best to reassure Aziza.\n",
    "Stephen Curry taking rightful spot as 3-point king; his next challenge is joining LeBron among all-time greats\n\nTuesday night, or in the coming days, Stephen Curry will drain yet another 3-point shot in a career defined by them. This one -- No. 2,974 -- will make him statistically what he already is in fact: The greatest shooter in the game's history.\n\nThere will be stories, highlights, praise, applause and the appropriate focus on this monumental accomplishment, and on Curry's stunning, still-running career.\n\nBut in front of Steph and still within his grasp -- stretching before him this season and likely in the seasons to come, past this singular achievement -- is a chance to do more than passing Ray Allen for the NBA's 3-point record. This opportunity is nothing less than a shot at solidifying himself as one of the five greatest players of all time.\n\nCurry does not fit the mold of an all-timer, and that has always been both part of his appeal with fans and part of the at-times (if now mostly expired) soft criticism from his contemporaries. Five years ago, in the midst of his run of back-to-back MVPs, more than a few handlers of NBA stars would happily order another drink if you'd humor them on the supposed overrated-reality of Curry.\n\nHe's smaller and less-explosive looking than Jordan, Kareem, Shaq, Kobe, LeBron, etc. But greatness isn't measured in the skills that could make something so, or in pure athletic superiority. \n\nGreatness is measured in what is so, and done, and won -- and Curry, after this 3-point record falls, will lead the NBA's best team. That rejuvenated Golden State Warriors squad, spurred on again by their star, could very well position Curry to tack on a third Most Valuable Player award and, more important in terms of legacy, a fourth NBA title.\n\nWhich, not for nothing, would give him just as many championships as LeBron James.\n\nSometimes one star's greatness can be unfairly dimmed in the light of another all-time great. Think Tim Duncan aside Kobe Bryant for most of their careers. Think Isiah Thomas sandwiched between Larry Bird-Magic Johnson on one side and Michael Jordan on the other. \n\nSteph is in a similar boat. He does not match LeBron James for sheer physicality, or a host of other on-court measurements of greatness. LeBron is, put simply, shockingly talented and accomplished in almost every way a basketball player can be. He could end his career as the NBA's all-time scoring leader and as the game's third- or fourth-best ever on the all-time assist list, to name a few.\n\nBut Steph has his own unique Mount Rushmore resume, one currently incomplete for a top five all-time player but certainly within reach. He's the greatest shooter of all time, a fact soon to be burnished by the record he will almost certainly set Tuesday against the New York Knicks at the Garden. He, like Jordan, has defined a generation of the sport and called forth a next generation crafted in his image -- imitators of not his skill but of how he's changed the game. Steph's greatness, while not as overpowering as LeBron's or deep in its breadth, nonetheless synthesizes rare talent into championships while defining a long span of the game.  \n\nSteph, unlike LeBron, never left to find rings. There is no Miami Heat stop to learn to be a champion. There is no Los Angeles Lakers defection. There is just the Warriors. Even his recruitment of a star -- Kevin Durant -- was more about Steph's ability to attract greatness and enhance it than, say, bolt for greener pastures or pull strings behind the scenes to bring in a player still under contract elsewhere.\n\nThat's not a knock at LeBron. But it is a notch for Steph. \n\nThe Lakers seem much less likely this year, and in the years ahead, to win titles than the Warriors. The idea of Steph claiming a fourth title, and LeBron not winning another one, is certainly plausible. \n\nAnd there's this: How many players, exactly, has LeBron James turned into a Hall of Famer? Steph's done it for two.\n\nI'm not arguing Steph can pass LeBron on the all-time list. LeBron's going to end his career no lower than No. 2, and much more likely as the sole GOAT. But it is to say Steph can cut down the distance between them in a way not enough see, nor acknowledge. \n\nToday's a pretty good day to take notice. \n\nLeBron's been on a quest for No. 1 all-time status since he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated as \"The Chosen One.\" Steph's own pursuit -- as a possible top five all-time player -- has not gotten the same attention, respect or acknowledgment. \n\nAll-time greats at the close of their careers can burnish -- or make -- their legacies. John Elway won two Super Bowls in his last two NFL seasons, saving the Broncos legend from being a lesser version of Dan Marino.\n\nPeyton Manning's second and final ring also came with the Broncos, a last run to glory more about defense than Manning's actual play that year -- but no less impactful for his all-time status.\n\nDuncan's 2015 title tied him with Kobe with five, linking them, for me, in a way we can't yet rule out for Steph and LeBron. Phil Mickelson won the PGA at age 50 last year. Tiger Woods took the Masters in 2019 after more than a decade-long drought. Clayton Kershaw's win with the Dodgers in last year's World Series is similarly legacy changing, and comes nearer the end of his career than the beginning. \n\nPoint is: The measurements of greatness and the impact of a career can't be properly understood until that career is truly over. Steph's isn't. LeBron was just named Western Conference Player Of The Week, but it's his quiet rival who has the larger chance at more titles and MVPs.\n\nAnd to do it post-Durant, in his 30s, after so many dismissed the once-dominant Warriors as a thing of the past? That's its own incredible accomplishment, if Steph can indeed carry his team to that place again.\n\n\"We're all witnesses to what Steph Curry has done in his career and the way that he's changed the game,\" LeBron told reporters last week. \"He's a once-in-a-lifetime basketball player.\"\n\nYes, he is. And in the end, Curry's career, while not exceeding the King's, may come closer than few thought possible.",

    "Victoria Scone says critics of her Drag Race UK appearance are \u2018misogynists\u2019\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK star Victoria Scone has said that she doesn\u2019t take people who criticise her right to do drag seriously as they are \u201cmisogynists\u201d.\n\nThe Cardiff-based drag queen is making history as the first cisgender woman to compete on any Drag Race franchise in the world.\n\nWhile her casting was widely praised for platforming diversity within the drag communities, a small number questioned the validity of her drag as a cis woman.\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Victoria, 27, said that she\u2019d been taken aback by the \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d response to her joining the new series.\n\n\u201cI know it seems that the negative is so horrific, but I can\u2019t take it personally because they are misogynists,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf your only reason for not enjoying me when you\u2019ve only seen a 90-second clip of me is that I\u2019m not a real drag queen, I can\u2019t take that personally. That\u2019s just because you have a problem with a woman doing drag.\u201d\n\nWhile Drag Race has come under fire in the past for predominantly featuring drag performers who are cisgender men, the show has worked in recent years to diversify its line-ups.\n\nA number of trans women have taken part in the competition, including Kylie Sonique Love, who recently won All Stars 6, while trans man Gottmik reached the final of season 13 in the US earlier this year.\n\nVictoria said that she had previously been frustrated with the show\u2019s portrayal of drag, but added: \u201cHow could I, as a cisgender woman, complain that there were no other cisgender women on the show if I wasn\u2019t applying myself?\u201d",
    "Nine-year-old helps teach educators about queer youth\n\nWhen a third-grade teacher from Texas asked her mostly eight-year-old students what they wanted to be when they grow up, one of them wrote on the white board: \u201cdrag queen\u201c. That response came from Keegan, now nine, a \u201cgender creative\u201c kid, in his mother\u2019s words, illustrating just one of the challenges facing educators as they accommodate the range of gender identities that students might express. Reuters has agreed not to fully identify the family and school at their request to protect them from potential harassment.\n\nEducators, who for centuries have divided students into boys and girls, are now figuring out better ways to address students who are nonbinary, gender fluid and gender nonconforming, in addition to transgender kids, whose gender identity differs from the one they were assigned at birth. By one survey nearly three per cent of youth in Minnesota fall under these categories, identifying with neither gender, or both, or trans, or just defying a traditional male/female binary option.\n\nSome school districts in the United States are using more gender-neutral language, addressing students by their preferred pronouns, which can be \u201cthey\u201d, \u201cthem\u201d, \u201ctheirs\u201d for an individual, or the invented \u201czie\u201d, \u201czir\u201d, \u201czirs\u201d, which are used as a substitute. Some schools also allow students to easily change their preferred name or gender identity.\n\nThe degree of acceptance for such students can literally be a matter of life and death, experts say. A national survey of 34,000 LGBT+ youth aged 13 to 24 released last week found 39 per cent seriously considered suicide in the past 12 months, as did more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth, according to the Trevor Project, a pro-LGBT+ group focused on suicide prevention.\n\nAnother study, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2018 and based on a cohort study of 129 trans and gender nonconforming youth aged 15 to 21, found that suicide attempts plummet 65 per cent and depression symptoms fall 71 per cent if they are allowed to use their chosen name at school, home, work and with friends.\n\nKeegan, 8, relaxes after a drag class at the home of his 'Fairy Drag Mothers,' Robby and Alex, near Austin, Texas. Keegan's parents sought the help of the drag community to help mentor their son, who identifies as gender creative and recently came out as gay, to aid him with his drag skills. His mother, Megan, says the family was surprised that Keegan came as gay at the early age of 9, but happy he is relieved to have the weight lifted off his shouldersKeegan's drag name is Kween-Kee-Kee. Here he sits with his mother side-stage prior to Keegan's debut drag performance during the Austin International Drag Festival 2018Keegan, his brother Noah, 10, parents, Megan and Chris, take a trip with his drag queen mentors, Robby (right), 26, and Alex, 27, to Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts. The fabric brought was to be used for a new costume Robby would make as a gift to Keegan for his 9th birthdayRobby, a drag queen, 25, applies makeup on Keegan during a drag lesson, as his home. As the years have progressed, so has Keegan's fascination with all things drag, evolving from a hobby into an upcoming paid performance. Keegan's mother felt in need of aid that she could not provide and so sought the help of the drag community to guide him. She contacted a married couple named Robby and Alex, who perform drag professionally, to help educate her son on performing and act as mentors\nThe issue comes up long before adolescence as gender identity typically manifests itself in children by kindergarten. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is nothing less than the future lives of these children and our health as a society,\u201d said Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN, a national advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) students. \u201cWe still live in a world where the most marginalised are not receiving the support and affirmation that they need in order to achieve academically and thrive personally. And we all will benefit when that is true,\u201d Byard said.\n\nTransgender rights have risen to the fore in recent years and as LGBTQ people prepare to mark the 50th anniversary since the Stonewall uprising of 28 June 1969. The protests by patrons of a New York City gay bar, who fought back against police harassment, is considered the birth of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. Keegan is one student who has benefited from the Stonewall legacy. He plays soccer and video games and also likes to dress as a girl, using the name Kween-Kee-Kee when in drag, his parents say. Among his mentors are a pair of real-life adult drag queens. He usually goes by the pronouns \u201che\u201d, \u201chim\u201d and \u201chis\u201d.\n\nKeegan has found acceptance and support at his school in a conservative, Christian suburb outside of Austin, Texas, his mother said. \u201cWe expected a lot of pushback from the school and we expected some intolerance, but we\u2019ve been very surprised.\u201d\n\nKeegan\u2019s teacher paid close attention during the lesson on financial literacy, when other students aspired to be doctors and dentists and Keegan wrote \u201cdrag queen\u201d. \u201cOne of the students asked, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 and Keegan kind of said \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 and moved past it,\u201d said his teacher. \u201cBut I do see little, like, hints of him trying to make people aware that this is something that he is, something that he does.\u201d\n\nNeither Keegan\u2019s teacher nor his principal said they received any formal training on educating gender nonconforming students and have worked with intuition and observation.

Here are six tools that let you write longer Twitter content.\n\nIn late-2017, Twitter doubled the number of characters allowed in tweets from 140 to 280.\n\nFor some users, however, 280 character still aren't enough. So, if you have something important to say, you need to know how to write longer tweets. So here are seven easy ways to do just that.\n\n1. TwitLonger\n\nTwitLonger is perhaps the most well-known app for writing longer tweets; it's been around almost as long as Twitter itself.\n\nIt's easy to get started with TwitLonger. To begin, head to the TwitLonger website and click Write a Post in the upper right-hand corner. If it's your first time using the app, you will need to give TwitLonger permission to access your Twitter account.\n\nWhen you're ready, type your tweet in the box, give it a title if you wish, and click Post It. On the final screen, you can click Reply to create a thread of longer tweets.\n\nOn the posted tweet, TwitLonger will add a link to the rest of your message. Anyone can access it; there is no way to restrict your longer tweet to specific users.\n\nIf you find yourself using the app a lot, you can subscribe for $1/month to remove the ads.\n\n2. Take a Screenshot\nThis is a simple-yet-effective workaround for posting longer tweets. Using screenshots to write longer messages is a growing trend. You've probably seen people using the \"cheat\" in your own timeline.\n\nThe principle is simple. Use one of these note-taking apps for Android or iOS and write what you want to say. Just make sure it all fits on one screen.\n\nNext, take a screenshot of what you've said and fire up the Twitter app. Tap on the new tweet icon and attach the screenshot to your tweet. You don't even need to write any text. When you're ready, press Tweet.\n\n3. Create a Twitter Thread\n\nNot long after the increase to 280 characters, Twitter launched its Threads feature. The feature lets you create a series of connected tweets than display in a continuous scroll format when viewed through the app. It's a way to tweet longer thoughts and ideas without relying on external apps and tools.\n\nTo create a thread on Twitter, start composing a tweet in the usual way. When you're ready to write the second tweet, click on the + button.\n\nYou can post an entire thread at the same time by clicking the Tweet all button. You can also add more tweets to a thread at a later time by selecting Continue Thread > Add to your last tweet from the Compose window. Click on the More icon (three horizontal dots) to continue older threads.\n\n4. JumboTweet\n\nJumboTweet is another easy-to-use web client for anyone that wants to make a long tweet. As with TwitLonger, you log into the site using your current Twitter credentials. You can write as much text as you like, and a link to your extended text will be included in your tweet.\n\nClick Sign in with Twitter to get started. Once you've authenticated the app, you'll be redirected back to the message screen.\n\nGo ahead and write your message, but before you post it, make sure you pay attention to the settings at the bottom of the page. JumboTweet maintains its own feed of content that was written in the app. To prevent your tweet from appearing in the company's feed, uncheck the box next to Display the post publicly on JumboTweet stream.\n\n5. ControlC\n\nControlC is a great way to share any extended content with a lot of people online; it's not Twitter-specific. That said, it's a fantastic tool to use for longer tweets.\n\nUnlike every other app we've covered, ControlC offers text formatting. You can edit font size, text style, text color, and more.\n\nAs such, it's a great way to quickly share longer content that extends beyond a simple few sentences. For example, perhaps you want to share some technical instructions or detailed directions and need to highlight certain parts of the text.\n\nTo use the app, write and format your text in the on-screen box. When you're ready, click Submit, and you'll get a link to share with other people. Sadly, you cannot send the link to Twitter directly from the web app.\n\n6. Tweet Compressor\n\nWe've all written tweets that are a few characters too long and ended up scanning the text over and over for any little savings that can be found.\n\nRather than doing the hard work yourself, you should just paste your tweet into the Tweet Compressor site.\n\nIt uses unicode to replace specific two-letter combos with single characters. The compressible combinations are:\n\nYou can see what the Unicode replacements look like in the image. For those who don't know, Unicode is an IT standard that allows for the consistent encoding of all the world's writing systems. It has almost 150,000 characters in total.\n\nTweet Compressor uses single-character unicode replacements such as Roman numerals and scientific abbreviations.\n\n7. Twishort\n\nTwishort lets you write a long tweet and post it directly to Twitter.\n\nHowever, the service really shines thanks to the iOS app and Chrome browser extension. The iOS and Chrome apps are the only way you can attach images and videos to the longer tweets you created on Twisort.\n\nThe app used to be available on Android too, but at the time of writing, it is no longer listed on the Google Play Store.\n\nIf you are using the web app, you can reply directly to another tweet with a long reply. You can also send a long tweet directly to another user via Twitter's mention feature.\n",

    "THE POWER OF THE DOG: Jane Campion's Solemn, Haunting Western is Among the Year's Best - Film Inquiry\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly a decade since Jane Campion made a film, and nearly three(!) since she broke onto the scene with the Acadamy Award-winning The Piano. But in all that time, with films like An Angel at My Table and Bright Star, she never lost her touch. And with The Power of the Dog, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s still got it; it\u2019s a revelatory film, with incredible performances, a haunting soundtrack, and a take on gender roles that is among the most profound of any recent film. In a time where movies appear to have been finally making a comeback, it is one of the year\u2019s best.\n\nNot Your Typical Western\nBased on a novel by Thomas Savage, The Power of the Dog takes place in 1925 in Montana. It\u2019s not quite the Old West, but there are remnants of it remaining, as well are indications of the modern world to come. The film focuses on a few select individuals. First, we see George Burbank (Jesse Plemons), an easy-going ranch owner, who is at odds with his gruff, grisly brother Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch). After a cattle drive, they come upon an inn owner named Rose Gordon (Kirsten Dunst) and her effeminate son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee). While Phil is brash and rude to them, George is much warmer, and soon finds himself attracted to Rose. Later, they marry, and Rose moves to live at the ranch that George owns with Phil. Phil, who immediately takes a disliking to Rose, finds himself at odds with her. And once her son comes to live with them during a break from school, things start to spiral out of control.\n\nWhat may take some accustoming during a viewing of The Power of the Dog is its rather languid pace; though three acts can distinctly be made out (the film is also split into chapters), it still takes some time to get to its main purpose. But sly, subtle hints are planted throughout on the way to get there, which you may not even think twice about until a bigger revelation comes later on. Essentially, Campion\u2018s film is a slow-burner, gradually sinking its teeth into its audience as opposed to chomping down immediately. It\u2019s so effective that you may not realize just how caught up in its spell you are until the film\u2019s final moments. Stick around; it\u2019ll be worth the wait.\n\nSubverting Roles\nOne of the most defining attributes of The Power of the Dog, as it should be with almost any Western, is its sense of time and place. While the film takes place in an empty plain that looks straight out of the Old West, there are also signs of the developing industrial world, such as cars, plumbing, and electricity. Standing in-between two worlds is fitting, though, as that\u2019s where most of our characters are as well. From the start, they initially seem straight out of a Western, especially Benedict Cumberbatch\u2018s Phil, with his long overalls, cowboy boots with spurs, and dirty complexion. You also have Kirsten Dunst\u2018s Rose, who seems like the calm, motherly type at the start. And Kodi Smit-McPhee\u2018s Peter appears to fit the role of an inexperienced adolescent, in need of some guidance from a more adept cowboy.\n\nBut it\u2019s where Campion subverts these roles that make these characters that much more distinguished. You see subtle hints as to their true nature; as one example, the seemingly harmless Peter at one point cuts open a rabbit to examine its insides, claiming that he needs to learn how to do so if he wants to be a surgeon. As another, you see Phil continuously mock Peter for his lack of manliness, yet on his own, he seems much cleaner and softer, leading you to wonder if he is putting up a facade. Meanwhile, the level-headed Rose starts to lose her cool as a result of Phil\u2019s brash nature, leading her down a dark path. People are never quite who they appear to be on the surface in The Power of the Dog, and Campion slowly but surely unravels who they truly are.\n\nThe characterization is made all the more effective by the performances of its central cast. Kodi Smit-McPhee, for one, who initially seems to be just a side character, soon gets a much larger role, showing the development of his character through his own sophisticated acting chops. While Kirsten Dunst, who doesn\u2019t need to prove much, has a memorable performance as a do-good woman pushed beyond the edge of her sanity. Jesse Plemons (Dunst\u2019s real-life husband) perhaps doesn\u2019t get as much of a chance to shine here, as he steps aside to make way for the film\u2019s final act, but he still stands on his own as a kindly man wishing to do well for both sides of his family.\n\nIt\u2019s Benedict Cumberbatch, though, that provides the film with its most interesting character study. As an accomplished actor who is mainly known for his larger blockbuster roles, he continually stuns here, bringing forth the charisma, brashness, and subtleties necessary for the role, in a way that makes you hate his character but finding yourself unable to look away from his piercing gaze. It\u2019s a powerhouse performance that will make you wish for more roles like this for the actor in the future.\n\nVisual Flair and Use of Sound\nWhile the performances of the cast are excellent, as is the story itself, it\u2019s the way that Campion portrays these aspects that will get under your skin. She does this in a few unique ways. For one, the lighting of the film is mostly muted; much of it is portrayed from within the confines of a few select households, and mainly one in particular: that of the Burbank ranch. When we do step outside, the camera doesn\u2019t focus on the landscape with a sense of awe, but instead that of uncertainty, showing tight closeups of characters\u2019 faces, odd camera angles, and slow-motion shots. Even a wide shot of the hills beyond is coupled with a sense of dread. Perhaps, as with the characters themselves, things aren\u2019t quite what they seem out here. And that\u2019s the feeling that permeates throughout.\n\nIt would be amiss for me to not mention the sound as well. There are musical motifs repeated throughout, such as by Phil, who consistently hums a few notes of a song that Rose had been attempting on the piano as a way to mock her. Or something as simple as the noises of the bristle of a comb being brushed, which can be grating. Rarely is there a quiet moment to be had in The Power of the Dog, and when there is, it\u2019s that much eerier in contrast.\n\nThe score itself is composed by Jonny Greenwood, which contains a mixture of guitar strumming, grandiose orchestral pieces, and some offbeat sound effects. It creates an unsettling effect, where even character interactions that are seemingly innocent feel sinister in nature. At times, though, it is a bit overused, and this is perhaps the film\u2019s only recognizable flaw. It occurs in a few moments, for example, leading up to the final climactic scene of the film, in which the score is still overpowering despite the fact that the moment should be more subtle in nature. Thankfully, other than this, it happens only a handful of times throughout the film, and as a whole, Greenwood\u2018s score is amongst his finest yet.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, The Power of the Dog is a haunting, powerful character study by Jane Campion. It doesn\u2019t shout its overall intention, and indeed you may be scratching your head for some time afterward, but its whisper is one worthy of thundering applause. It may be among the most unsettling films of the year, as well as one of Jane Campion\u2018s career-best. The performances of its central actors are amongst their finest as well, in particular Benedict Cumberbatch, who is likely to see some attention come awards season. At any rate, this is a highlight of 2021, and not a film to be missed.",
    "THE KING'S MAN: More Class Than Crass While Still Kicking Ass\nAfter the wildly questionable sequel of Kingsman: The Golden Circle, this prequel picture feels like an incredibly fresh start for this secret agent saga. Though based on the comic by Mark Millar, The King\u2019s Man has little to do with its prior source material, which is pretty par for the course with any adaptation of Millar\u2019s comics.\n\nDitching most of the camp and silliness, here\u2019s a film with a dose of retro classiness and its wicked tongue firmly in cheek. There are no exploding heads or robot dogs but some fantastically shot sword-fights and tense historical battles. More grit than wink helps give this entry the most prestige.\n\nA Man of War and Peace\nIt also doesn\u2019t hurt to have someone as veteran as Ralph Fiennes leading this picture. He plays Orlando Oxford, a man who has seen the horrors of war and is hoping to lead a more pacifist life. That life seems hard to maintain in the early 20th century when World War I is just on the horizon. Having lost his wife during a violent exchange in a war-torn region, he vows to not only never kill again but make sure his son Conrad (Harris Dickinson) will never no such tragedy. That may be easier said than done when conflict seems inevitable.\n\nA dark and secret plot is at hand where history\u2019s greatest masterminds join forces to stage a war. Led by a mysterious figure who wants to destabilize the United Kingdom, a show organization of conspirators grease the wheels of conflict. This includes the manipulative and mystical Grigori Rasputin (Rhys Ifans) and the occultist schemer Erik Jan Hanussen (Daniel Br\u00fchl). All of them collaborate in instigating a war by manipulating King George, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Tsar Nicholas, all three of them played by Tom Hollander.\n\nA Crisis of Conflict\nThankfully, Orlando also has his own secret organization of conflict-stoppers, led with his trusty help of Shola (Djimon Hounsou) and Polly (Gemma Arterton). They have an entire network of butlers and maids around the globe that can easily infiltrate any organization, making them the most effective spy organization. Whether he\u2019ll use their expertise, however, is another question, given Orlando\u2019s reluctance to jump into an international conflict.\n\nThe decision for Orlando\u2019s involvement is made all the more compelling by the acts of his strong-willed son Conrad. He desperately wants to join the war effort and prove himself in combat. This is much to the chagrin of Orlando who tries with all his might to keep his son out of the trenches. Such pushing, however, maybe his undoing as some tough lessons will have to be learned about not standing by when evil is afoot.\n\nBursting With Action\nDirector Matthew Vaughn once more guns a gauntlet of wild action. There\u2019s some somber pathos that hits kinda hard when watching Orlando endure death in the family. The scenes of World War I set in the trenches are also pretty brutal and shot in a rather horrific manner. But there are also plenty of exciting fights and exaggerated adventures. This is a film that\u2019s clearly not aiming to be entirely historically accurate and has a lot of Indiana Jones-style fun with its staging.\n\nBy far the most unorthodox of scenes features Orlando engaging in combat with the conspiring Rasputin at a dinner party. But this is no ordinary portrayal of Rasputin. This long-haired conspirator performs healing mantras, licks wounds semi-sexually, speaks rather openly about sex like a teenager who just learned the F word, and performs Russian ballet kung-fu with knives. This scene also involves swords, guns, vomit, and a pie being shoved into Rasputin\u2019s beard. Did I mention that Fiennes is pant-less during this duel?\n\nA Fiennes For All Seasons\nFiennes is in top form for this action picture without feeling out of place. He brings the class you want in a weathered soldier aiming for a more comfortable life amid the power he can wield. There\u2019s a great range to how he can easily go from a proper spy with style to a bitter mess of a man grieving in a bottle. It should be noted that you get a lot of different looks for Fiennes in this film.\n\nThere\u2019s the moment one would expect of him as a classic spy by strolling in a snappy suit and bowler hat with a cane in hand. But then you also get him being a dad with a knit sweater and then becoming a drunken mess with a beard and wearing a scarf by a fire. He\u2019s far more than just a stoic intelligence expert and it\u2019s great to see his personality reflect his rotating wardrobe.\n\nYou absolutely can\u2019t forget the supporting cast though. Rhys Ifans brings real power to his presence but also a great signal for when things are about to get weird. His conversations with Fiennes during a dinner party are so wildly inappropriate that you just no some intense stuff is about to go down soon, especially with how openly he talks about his penchant for sex and his hatred of the British.\n\nGemma Arterton brings the right amount of sass and commentary to the action, her highlight punchline being that guns are more efficient than knives and swords. That may be true but then we wouldn\u2019t get to watch Djimon Hounsou kick some major ass with his fast moves, where the cunning butler isn\u2019t afraid to get in close for kills. Harris Dickinson also delivers just as much fierceness in his performances, getting shirtless for knife practice and down-and-dirty for trench warfare.\n\nEvery villain is also perfectly played up for their evilness, acting as capable and conniving as any classic Bond henchman. Also, be sure to keep an eye out for a brief supporting role by Stanley Tucci. I won\u2019t reveal who he plays as it\u2019s more fun to search for him in this cavalcade of a cast.\n\nSeriously, The Action Is Great\nThe action is a real treat considering how much it differentiates from the other Kingsman movies. A connection between the two in terms of direction is that both movies had that \u201cone-shot\u201d moment where it feels like a fight scene is rather long with a camera that whips around chaotic violence.\n\nI\u2019m pleased to report that Vaughn doesn\u2019t fall back on this shooting style for this prequel. He gets crafty with cuts and finds some fascinating shots to mix things up. I particularly dug the climactic sword-fight where a few of the camera angles are from the hilts of the swords. The scene is also staged brilliantly for Oxford attacking the mastermind antagonist atop a high mountain in his barn where a film projector is running for the entire battle.\n\nCampy Yet Compelling\nThere\u2019s a dynamic and earnest nature to how this film proceeds that it\u2019s easy enough to go along for the ride. It never goes too overboard with the ridiculousness of exaggerating the setting but still goes into some odd places. Without giving too much away, the third-act mission involves a sex tape that is crucial in winning World War I. Sounds crazy, right? Yet Vaughn manages to make it a believable conclusion. After all, this mission is revealed after we\u2019ve already seen Orlando deflect an assassin\u2019s bullet during a parade and Rasputin lick Orlando\u2019s bullet wound.\n\nBut the distinction between this version of Kingsman and its predecessors feels like night and day. Sure, there\u2019s an oddness to how the picture plays with history, including a mid-credit scene that introduces another historical power player like he was a villain in an upcoming Marvel movie. Yet the film rarely winks at the viewer in a cheeky manner as the other movies. You don\u2019t need that for an exciting moment where Fiennes jumps out of a tumbling plane and scales a snowy cliff with mountain goats attacking him. No punchline is required for such excitement or even the hilarious pay-off with the goats later on.\n\nConclusion: The King\u2019s Man\nThe King\u2019s Man is a fantastic adventure with thrilling action as sharp as its style and wit. It\u2019s a picture that manages to find some genuine character amid all its Rasputin ridiculousness and presidential sex tapes. The key certainly lies in Fiennes and his lead role, marching into this role with the utmost sincerity and classiness. His performance in everything from heated conversations to dangerous missions atop cliffs sells the excitement so well.\n\nCombined with Vaughn\u2019s ability to try out new angles in his fast-paced style, there\u2019s a genuine surprise to this entry that may surpass Kingsman: The Secret Service to be the best of this series. This picture is elevated beyond just being a playful pick-and-parody of the spy genre, finding the humor where it lies but also the grit and pathos where it is needed most. It\u2019s just an incredibly fun film and could easily be my favorite action movie of 2021.",
    "DON'T LOOK UP: Adam McKay Reaches For The Stars\nThere is no shortage of disaster films throughout the history of cinema. As devastating as the destruction they illuminate is, at the end of the day, the world comes together in a showcase of unification and humanity, inevitably saving the day in the end. But what if the disaster wasn\u2019t averted, what if the signs were ignored and greed rang true. What if the disaster we thought was coming was already here?\n\nAdam McKay brilliantly delivers the answers to these questions, his latest film Don\u2019t Look Up a political satire that uniquely captures the devastating effects of climate change and our unwillingness to not only change it, but acknowledge it. And with 2020 still fresh in our minds, and the pandemic still raging, Don\u2019t Look Up finds deeper meaning and a grander aesthetic that not only challenges the conversation but demands action \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.\n\nDefining a Disaster\nDon\u2019t Look Up is undeniably a disaster movie, but it turns our expectations on their head. Rather than the disaster crashing into our world view, instead, it calls out our ecocentric behaviors, unafraid to point a finger directly at the audience, politicians, and people of power. There are opportunities to fix the impending environmental disasters, yet we turn to profit and short-sighted political gains instead. And time is running out.\n\nAs the film opens on Jennifer Lawrence\u2018s Kate Bibiasky, it feels like the beginning of Armageddon or Deep Impact. An aspiring doctorate candidate making the biggest discovery of her career, only to find her discovery will be her last. It was in these moments, and others, viewers can feel disaster movies of the past reverberating through the film\u2019s fundamental core. As you watch Kate and Dr. Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) celebrate the discovery, it\u2019s hard not to recall Deep Impact\u2018s young Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovering the comet that would inevitably crash into earth. Yet, where there are similarities on the surface, Don\u2019t Look Up dives deeper, welcoming character development and depth bringing an authenticity that has been absent from disaster films of the past.\n\nWhere editing would skip the anxiety, panic attacks, travel, and literal waiting previously, here, Don\u2019t Look Up embraces the in-between and how it might actually go down. Fear is allowed to exist, the characters the central focus, not the comet itself. Honestly, there are few scenes where the comet is actually seen, keeping the focus on the characters, and even more importantly, the message.\n\nAnd as the comet\u2019s discovery is made, and political forces are brought into play, there is a tension created, a feeling that this \u201ccan not really be happening\u201d and a deeply invested belief that change will come at any moment. We have been trained as an audience as to what we should expect in a disaster film, an arch to the story and its characters that never truly breaks from its predestined formula. But Don\u2019t Look Up challenges the status quo while challenging our standpoint and perspective.\n\nDelivering Medicine One Spoonful at A Time\nDon\u2019t Look Up could have easily crumbled under the weight of the reality it is tackling, yet it finds its strength in its cast, dialogue, and humor. As heavy-handed as it is, the harsh criticisms and examinations are more easily digested with its constant doses of \u201csugar\u201d. After all, \u201csugar helps the medicine go down\u201d.\n\nWhere it could have severely felt the weight, threatening an all-out collapse, is in its \u201cin your face\u201d messaging. And while I have seen others complain it\u2019s too on point, that was the point. To deliver a message on environmentalism that can easily be accepted, but also be delivered with a punch. It is upfront and in your face with purpose and intention, every element and fiber of the film unafraid to speak its own truth. It is in the unbridled restraint that Don\u2019t Look Up finds its true catharsis, its characters and even the director saying exactly what we need to hear, and what we might like to say ourselves.\n\nDon\u2019t Look Up finds its strength even further in its incredible cast. This is a film that shines as an ensemble, each character working off the other, no role insignificant to the story or message. Through the actions of its characters, ripple effects are shown, not only displaying the effects we have on the environment but on each other as well. Though it is not without its standout stars. Jennifer Lawrence returns from a three-year acting hiatus, her delivery a resonating example of ambition and strength, her performance one that will strike the hearts of a generation screaming into a void. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as well, the deeply rooted anxiety and manipulability of Dr. Mindy a permanent part of his psyche. It was refreshing to see him take on a character that lacks the strength and fortitude of self, giving DiCaprio another chance to stretch his acting prowess even further.\n\nRob Morgan as Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe encompasses the fortitude of patriotism, allowing his character the breadth to maneuver through the debatable strength and resilience of fighting for one\u2019s country over self-preservation. Mark Rylance and Meryl Streep are also notable, their characters\u2019 combined drive and ambition both working with and against each other to the film\u2019s desired effect. Cate Blanchette is immersive, almost unrecognizable when she first appears on the screen. Like DiCaprio, she stretches further in her own repertoire, bringing a playfully devious performance to life. And I would be remised if I didn\u2019t mention Jonah Hill and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, whose performances we have seen elements of throughout their careers, but their chemistry with Lawrence shines each in their own unique and awkward ways.\n\nDon\u2019t Look Up rounds out its incredible success through its intriguing editing style. Timelines are broken, interlacing both past and present, heightening tension, and adding extra authenticity to the action on screen. At times even, it feels as though I am cycling through a social media thread or Tick Tok feed. There is a relatability that is derived from this type of fast-paced editing, its messaging is further easily digested in the similarity to the methods of social media consumption.\n\nThe editing goes a step further to, almost boarding a surrealist take. While scenes are interlaced within each other, footage of various animals and environmental scenes are worked in as well. There is this feeling that in the face of disaster the world goes on, but there is something deeper. As the tension surrounding the impending asteroid increases, viewers are constantly reminded that it is not just us we are trying to save, but an entire plant. There is beauty being missed as the time to take action slips by. Again a messaging at times too on the mark. But that\u2019s the point.\n\nConclusion: Don\u2019t Look Up\nThere is no mistaking that this is one of the best films of the year. It is unafraid and unrestrained, an artistic example of art imitating life. This is no Armageddon, the United States is not the savior and if we don\u2019t act soon, we are fated to have life imitate art. Adam McKay has crafted a harsh examination of our treatment and lack of action of the environment we live in, one that is sure to not only push the conversation but retain its relevance for years to come.",
    "How Camila Cabello Responded to Shawn Mendes' \u2018It'll Be Okay\u2019 Lyrics, Which Seem to Be About Their Split\nCamila made her stance on the breakup song pretty public.\n\nJust two weeks after Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes announced their breakup, Mendes released a song that seems to document the end of a romantic relationship. While Mendes didn't provide much commentary about what inspired the song, the Canadian singer previously said that basically every love song he's written has been about Cabello.\n\nIn his Wonder documentary, Mendes recalled saying to Cabello, \u201cMy song comes on the radio or something and I'm like, \u2018Everything's about you. They're all, they have always been about you.\u2019 She goes, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Like, they're all about you. Like every song I've ever wrote.\u201d\n\nLyrically, \u201cIt'll Be Okay\u201d matches what sources have said about Cabello and Mendes' romantic relationship just fizzling out. Lines like \u201cIf you tell me you're leaving, I'll make it easy/It'll be okay/If we can't stop the bleeding/We don't have to fix it, we don't have to stay/I will love you either way\u201d complement the vibe sources close to the couple conveyed about the relationship running its course.\n\n\u201cThe relationship was getting stale and complacent and they decided they are better off being friends,\u201d a source told E!, noting that Mendes initiated the breakup conversation in November.\n\nA source told People in late November that \u201cthey had this intense relationship last year and spent months together during the lockdown in Miami. They both seemed very happy and looked like they enjoyed having a break from working. Things are different now, though. It's more back to normal life. They have careers that are taking them in different directions. They went from spending every day together to now not really spending any time together.\u201d\n\nIt also matches the sentiment Cabello and Mendes shared in their breakup statement that they intend to remain friends and still love each other. They wrote:\n\nSo how does Cabello feel about Mendes already releasing a breakup song seemingly about them? She's supportive, she made very clear. She liked his Instagram announcing the song was out.\n\nRead the full lyrics, via Genius, and listen to \u201cIt'll Be Okay\u201d below:\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.

    "Blaming the weather is a trap\n\u201cIf it were only nicer out, I\u2019d be happier.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just a step away from, \u201cIf the current world crisis would abate, then I\u2019d be able to concentrate.\u201d\n\nWhich is not that far from, \u201cIf you would simply behave, I wouldn\u2019t be upset.\u201d\n\nWhen we focus on external forces and tie them directly to our state of mind, we\u2019re giving up agency.\n\nThe hard-won privilege of being in control of our own status and peace of mind.\n\nWithout a doubt, there are situations that are unfair, abusive or dangerous. And we should work to fix them or walk away if we possibly can. However, we don\u2019t have to link these external forces to the way we choose to talk to ourselves. We can decide to claim possibility and take action instead.\n\nRoz Zander teaches us to avoid, \u201cI\u2019m on vacation but it\u2019s raining.\u201d It\u2019s far more powerful and useful to think, \u201cI\u2019m on vacation and it\u2019s raining\u2026 what should I do with this moment?\u201d\n\nThe story we tell ourselves belongs to us and only us. It\u2019s entirely possible that someone selfishly or thoughtlessly put a story there. It\u2019s possible that there isn\u2019t enough empathy or fairness or opportunity. But once we see that we\u2019re able to own our story, we gain a huge amount of power. And we retain that power for as long as we refuse to hand it over to someone else.\n\nIf the blame and the anger isn\u2019t going to change the situation, better to reclaim our agency instead.",
    "Two Sigma Financial Modeling Code Competition, 5th Place Winners\u2019 Interview: Team Best Fitting\n\nKaggle\u2019s inaugural code competition, the Two Sigma Financial Modeling Challenge ran from December 2016 to March 2017. Over 2,000 players competed to search for signal in unpredictable financial markets data. As the very first code competition, competitors experimented with the data, trained models, and made submissions directly via Kernels, Kaggle\u2019s in-browser code execution platform.\n\nIn this winners\u2019 interview, team Bestfitting describes how they managed to remain a top-5 team even after a wicked leaderboard shake-up by focusing on building stable models and working effectively as a team. Read on to learn how they accounted for volatile periods of the market and experimented with reinforcement learning approaches.\nWhat was your background prior to entering this challenge?\nBestfitting: I\u2019ve worked as software developer for more than 15 years and as a machine learning & deep learning researcher for 5 years.\n\n\n\nZero: I worked as a bank data analyst for more than 4 years. I am enthusiastic about machine leaning.\n\n\n\n\nCircleCircle: I am a data analyst working on risk-control related solutions for banks.\n\n\n\nDo you have any prior experience or domain knowledge that helped you succeed in this competition?\nWe learned a lot of skills from previous Kaggle competitions, such as feature analysis, feature selection, validation set build and how to control over-fitting.\n\nAccording to our experiences in bank data analysis, we prefer to keep models stable in all kinds of market situations. We don\u2019t pursue excessive public scores; a profitable yet stable model is the best.\n\nHow did you get started competing on Kaggle?\nBestfitting: I need all kinds of datasets and challenges to validate algorithms I\u2019ve learned.\n\nZero: When I learned CS229 by Andrew Ng, he advised us to enter a competition.\n\nCircleCircle: Kaggle is a great platform, I learned a lot from forums, and then, I decided to enter a competition and have a try.\n\nWhat made you decide to enter this competition?\nWe entered this competition for two reasons:\n\nFirst, as we know, Two Sigma is a very successful and creative company and we guessed the competition they hosted should be very interesting\n\nSecond, predicting financial market is very hard, we want to see how well we can do by using machine learning skills.\n\nSummary\nWe are very happy with the result: we are the only team that stayed in the top 5 on both public and private leaderboards. We feel we are very lucky, but we can not win a competition only by luck; we did a lot of work to ensure profitable yet stable models.\n\nWe tried to build effective methods to evaluate our models and control risks, although we don\u2019t have much financial background, we wanted to learn some ideas about quantitative investment.\n\n\nWe used 4 kinds of features:\n\nBasic features. Original features from the dataset which two-sigma provided.\nCalculated features and lag features. Get by using simple functions on basic features, such as abs, log, standard deviation, and so on. We also used features of last few timestamps which are called lag-N features.\nPredicted features. Predicted from first level weak model. They were used in second level model.\nWhole-market features. We tried to build some features to get information from whole market: increasing or decreasing, calm or volatile. They were also used in our self-adaptive strategy.\nValidation\nWe wanted to introduce some validation methods we used through the whole competition.\n\nThe first one is the Cumulative-R: we plotted the cumsum of R to find the performance as time goes on.\n\nAnd we defined another simple reward value, we called it y-sign-R. For each sample, if the predicted y has same sign of real y, then the reward is 1, otherwise, -1. We summed the reward value up, and plot cumsum curve, we can see the curve on right side. If the cumsum of y-sign-R is less than zero, we think it is not a good model because they are not better than random guess. We can see that both the ET and LR model performed not so well, especially the ET model.\n\n\nModels\nWe developed our models independently before we teamed up. Bestfitting and Zero\u2019s model can get top-10 on private LB individually. We did not use CircleCircle\u2019s model in final ensemble model due to run time limitation of the competition, but we used some features from her model.\n\nBestfitting\u2019s model\n\n\nWe realized our models cannot identify the market environment, as we know, asset prices wave along with the whole market. So we plotted the y-mean of each timestamp and found that there were two volatile periods. We needed to add this information to the models.\n\n\nSo, we added mean of t_20 and t_30 of each timestamp and used it in ET model. The public score improved a lot and private score had a big improvement.\n\nBestfitting\u2019s post-processing\n\nBestFitting plotted the cumsum of real-y, y predicted by a ridge model, by ET model and an ensemble model. He found that the ET model had better performance in volatile periods especially while the market was increasing. And the ridge model has better performance in relatively calm/smooth periods.\n\nAnd he also found that the ridge model can predict y-sign much better, but the value it predicted was small, if the market is in volatile periods the R reward will be small although the sign is correct.\n\n\nSo he tried to make his model more adaptive and can select correct model in different periods.\n\nAt this stage, we have teamed up. We tried a lot of methods, including reinforcement learning, but we couldn\u2019t find a very stable reward, and time is limited, so we chose a rule based way.\n\nWe must let our model know whether the market is increasing or not, calm or volatile, so we defined some measurement, for example, we counted the sign of y_mean of last 5 timestamps, and used them as an indicator to ensemble Ridge and ET model dynamically. After these efforts his model went up to top 7 on public leader board and the private score dropped a little but it\u2019s healthy he thought.\n\n\nJourney of Bestfitting\u2019s improvement\n\nLet us have a look at Bestfitting\u2019s journey of improvement in one chart. We think the performance was getting better in a stable way. If the competition ended at any time, the model will not be over-fitting.\n\n\nZero\u2019s model\nBefore we teamed up, Zero\u2019s model had a decent public score, but the private score is not so good. After we teamed up, Zero added whole market features to his models and his public scores improved a little and his private scores had a huge improvement.\n\n\nZero\u2019s post-processing\nAfter we teamed up, the most important thing we did is to make our model adaptive. Zero used a different strategy: he wanted to let model know whether the market is in volatile periods by standard deviation. He evaluated the standard deviation of y_mean of last 5 timestamps and compared it with standard deviation of y-mean of the training set. He then ensembled the models dynamically.\n\n\nJourney of Zero\u2019s improvement\nNow, let us have a look at the journey of zero\u2019s improvement. As we can see, his model had a huge improvement in private score after we used whole-market features.\n\n\nEnsemble\nOK, let us go on with the ensemble of the two models.\n\nWe used weighted average of the two models, and we found that Zero\u2019s model had worse performance when the market is calm, so we gave small weights to Zero\u2019s model.\n\n\n\nTeamwork\nHow did your team form?\nWe built independent models before we teamed up, and we all had decent public score, but we were exceeded by other competitors as the competition went on. So we all realized that we needed to team up for stable models and good position.\n\nHow did your team work together?\nAfter teaming up, Bestfitting was in charge of the structure of the stable model and the concept or similar concept of reinforcement learning so that the model was self-adaptive and stable.\n\nZero integrated the source codes of the models and he improved the performance making it possible to finish in 1 hour. CircleCircle tried to build a reinforcement learning model and built better validation sets. She also evaluated the model under different market environments.\n\n\nWords of wisdom\nWhat have you taken away from this competition?\nWe would rather believe in local multiple verification methods compared to public scores, such as R value of accumulated timestamps, the comparison between predicted Y accumulated and true Y accumulated value, and accuracy of Y\u2019s positive or negative. So we could ensure the stability of model to get a certain income, but also to maintain a low risk.\n\nWe used whole market features to let our model have information about the market which let our models be stable.\n\nWe also tried some strategies to make our models more adaptive to different periods.\n\nDo you have any advice for those just getting started in data science?\nGet knowledge from good courses such as Stanford CS229 and CS231n.",
    "I thought my vision was pretty good. Not quite 20\u201320, but close. Then I read Thoreau.\n\nYes, that Thoreau. Forget what you may have read by or about the \u201chermit Concord.\u201d He is misunderstood. His experiment on Walden Pond was about seeing. All the rest \u2014 the solitude, the simplicity \u2014 were means to this end.\n\nReading Thoreau made me realize how little I saw. Sure, my eye captured light signals, and my mind processed them, but did I really see? I was, at best, a lazy seer. A lot of us are, which strikes me as odd, given that we live in an allegedly visual culture. The truth is: we are a visual culture the way McDonald\u2019s is a restaurant. We consume a lot of images but savor very few.\n\nNot Henry David Thoreau. His vision was legendary. At a glance, he could estimate the height of a tree or the weight of a calf. He\u2019d reach into a bushel of pencils and, by sight alone, grab exactly a dozen. He had a knack for finding buried Indian arrowheads. \u201cThere is one,\u201d he\u2019d say, kicking it up with his foot.\n\nUnlike his fellow Transcendentalists, Thoreau was less interested in cultivating \u201ca faith in things unseen.\u201d He had greater faith in things seen. He was less interested in the nature of reality than the reality of nature. Was there more to the world than meets the eye? Probably, but what does meet the eye is plenty miraculous, so let\u2019s start there. Thoreau valued vision even more than knowledge. Knowledge is always tentative, imperfect. Today\u2019s certainty is tomorrow\u2019s nonsense. As he said, \u201cWho can say what is? He can only say how he sees.\u201d\n\nHow exactly do we see? Most of us subscribe to the photographic model of seeing. We believe our eyes capture images from the world like a camera, then relay these images to our brain. Our eyes \u201cphotograph,\u201d say, the coffee mug in front of you.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice model. It is also wrong. Seeing is less like photography and more like language. We don\u2019t see the world so much as converse with it. Consider something as simple as seeing a coffee mug. We don\u2019t see the mug in front of us. We tell ourselves it is there. The coffee mug sends electromagnetic waves, nothing more, to your eye and brain. From that raw data, we create information, then meaning \u2014 in this case, that the object in front of us is called a \u201ccoffee mug.\u201d\n\nSometimes we create meaning too quickly. Maybe what looks like a coffee mug is something else entirely. Quick to define objects and people, we risk blinding ourselves to their uniqueness. Thoreau guarded against this tendency. \u201cLet me not be in haste to detect the universal law,\u201d he tells himself. \u201cLet me see more clearly a particular instance of it.\u201d Postpone defining what you see and you will see more.\n\nThoreau slowed the process to a crawl. He elongated the gap between hypothesis and conclusion, between seeing and seen. Time and again, he reminds himself to linger. \u201cWe must look for a long time before we can see,\u201d he said.\n\nThoreau cultivated an \u201cinnocence of the eye.\u201d It wasn\u2019t an act. He never lost the child\u2019s sense of wonder and openness to his surroundings. He couldn\u2019t pass a berry without picking it. \u201cHe is a boy and will be an old boy,\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson said of his friend.\n\nWe can\u2019t improve our vision without improving ourselves. Not only does who we are determine what we see but what we see determines who we are. As the Vedas say, \u2018What you see, you become.\u2019\n\nWe tend to put seeing and feeling in two separate categories. Not Thoreau. For him, seeing and feeling were intertwined. He couldn\u2019t see something if he didn\u2019t feel it. How he felt determined not only how he saw but what he saw. For him, seeing was not only emotive but also interactive. When he saw, say, a rose, he corresponded with it and, in a way, collaborated with it.\n\nSeeing is deliberate. It\u2019s always a choice, even if we don\u2019t realize it. It\u2019s all about the angles. No one played them better than Thoreau. Change your perspective and you change not only how you see but what you see. \u201cFrom the right point of view, every storm and every drop in it is a rainbow,\u201d he said.\n\nThoreau observed Walden Pond from every conceivable vantage point: from a hilltop, on its shores, a boat on its surface, and underwater. He viewed the same scene by daylight and moonlight, in winter and summer.\n\nThoreau rarely stared at anything directly. He looked with the side of his eye. There\u2019s a physiological basis for this. In dim light, we can detect objects best by looking at them from the side. Strange as it may seem, we see more with a sideways glance than a straight-ahead stare.\n\nThoreau was determined not to get stuck in a visual rut. That\u2019s why he was always altering his perspective. Sometimes only the slightest shift, \u201ca hair\u2019s breadth aside from our habitual path or routine,\u201d reveals new worlds: a rare bird, unusually far south for the winter, perhaps, or a glint of sunlight.\n\nAt other times, he took more drastic steps. He\u2019d bend over and peer through his legs, marveling at the inverted world. (Thoreau was big on inverting; he even flipped his name, changing it from David Henry to Henry David.) Turn the world upside down, and you see it anew.\n\nThe more familiar our surroundings the greater the need to play the angles. Anyone can be awed when first gazing at the Taj Mahal. It takes a truly creative seer to find beauty in the local 7\u201311.\n\nThoreau\u2019s stellar vision wasn\u2019t merely technique, a fun-pack of optical tricks. It was a function of character. He considered the perception of beauty \u201ca moral test.\u201d Beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. It is in his heart. We can\u2019t improve our vision without improving ourselves. Not only does who we are determine what we see but what we see determines who we are. As the Vedas say, \u201cWhat you see, you become.\u201d\n\nFor the past year, I\u2019ve made a real effort to see with Thoreauvian eyes. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t always work, but when it does, the payoff is enormous. A shattered smartphone screen, when viewed from the proper angle, is transformed into a work of abstract art. The pile of papers on my desk becomes my own private Everest. A seemingly insurmountable problem suddenly seems less daunting, more surmountable, when viewed from a distance \u2014 and at just the right angle.",
    "when I first heard this joke, it was about a Jewish man and kugel. But then I recently read this version on a messageboard:\nA man in Mexico was on his deathbed when he suddenly smelled tamales. His favorite food. He flung himself out of bed and dragged himself to the kitchen where he saw his wife busy cooking. With his last bit of strength, he reached for a tamale and his hand was immediately smacked with a wooden spoon.\n\u201cThose are for the funeral.\u201d\nI laughed. It spoke to me.\nA few days ago I dragged myself to a clinic to get a COVID-19 test. The line stretched around the block and it took almost three hours. Afterward, I emotionally ate two slices of pizza, one right after the other. On the street. Both pepperoni. There will be free pizza at my funeral. And tamales. Kugel, too.\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the highly-contagious coronavirus was first discovered and started percolating on the other side of the world. Since then, 800,000 Americans have died during the ensuing pandemic. Over five million people around the world have perished.\nI have received three shots of a vaccine, the most recent being a \u201cbooster\u201d to protect against variants of the virus. The newest mutation \u2014 named Omicron, which sounds like a Transformer\u2014 is currently surging through New York City. I know, right now, at least a half-dozen people, all vaxxed, who have come down with this new illness. The symptoms are milder, for now.\nOf course, the word \u201cmild\u201d has two meanings now. The first definition is, you know, \u201cnot severe\u201d but now it can also mean \u201cnot in a medically-induced coma.\u201d\nFor a few months, my life was almost normal. I wore masks on the subway, yes. I should have been doing that for years. I shudder to think of what I caught down there. My vaccination card was checked before entering movies, where I wore my mask. I saw friends, but we met and ate outdoors when we could. So this variant is an unwelcome surprise. As I stood in line, waiting, I received a text from a friend whose family of four are all sick, wheezing, and coughing together, canceling their holiday plans because no one wants to infect grandma.\nJust to be clear, I\u2019m not symptomatic. I was getting tested at the request of my ex-fiancee, whose sister is immunocompromised. She is taking care of my one-eyed dog for the holiday while I visit my family in Texas. If I visit my family. Should I visit my family?\nShe is going to pick up the pooch and we\u2019re going to say \u201chi,\u201d from a distance. My ex and I haven\u2019t seen each other in a while. I think she\u2019s doing as well as can be expected.\nWe survived the pandemic but our relationship did not. We spent most of last year living in a small house north of the city with her mother and sister. I made them countless stuffed peppers. I watched countless hours of Jeopardy! with them. We were terrified together, we laughed together, the four of us. But it was too much. The snow, the plague, the loss. We tried. She tried. I tried.\nThe world doesn\u2019t end with a whimper, it ends with a long, defeated sigh.\nI am still close with her family but I have a new life now. It\u2019s smaller, a little more fragile than I\u2019d like. But it\u2019s mine and I still make stuffed peppers, only not as many.\nAt the clinic, the nurse was visibly tired behind her mask. My eyes watered, as they always do when the swab enters my nostril. We didn't make small talk. I was just one more anxious person getting tested, one of who knows how many she\u2019d seen that day. Hundreds?\nI waited for my results and they are negative, and yet, during that time, thousands more New Yorkers tested positive. This is what living with a virus looks like. A few months of not thinking about sore throats or hospitals and then, suddenly, we\u2019re back.\nThere was a young man behind in the line outside the clinic who agreed with me when I cursed the wait.\n\u201cGoddammit.\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\nHe was probably ten, fifteen years younger. This is the worst he\u2019s seen he tells me. He gets a weekly test because he\u2019s unvaccinated and then there\u2019s a pause in our banter because the people who loudly refuse to get vaccinated are sometimes the same who mocked New York City in the spring of 2020. He told me he\u2019s unvaccinated almost sheepishly and I felt the anger in me rise and then I relaxed my fists. I didn\u2019t have the energy to hate him so I just asked him why he\u2019s unvaccinated.\nHe stammered: he was sick as a kid, had multiple surgeries, something about his lymph nodes. He\u2019s scared of the vaccine so he gets the test because that\u2019s his workplace\u2019s other option and so I drop it. It had been a long day. We\u2019re on our feet. He\u2019s getting texts and I\u2019m getting texts. So-and-so went to a party, so-and-so went to a show. People are testing positive. This feels like the beginning, all over again.\nI have another test scheduled for later this week, and then I\u2019ll make the decision about whether I should visit my mom, who is 78 and vulnerable. I already know what I have to do but I\u2019m going to spend another couple of days pretending I\u2019m going to see her.\nAnd so here I am, sitting in my apartment. Again. I\u2019m listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s melancholy power-pop album \u2018Folklore,\u2019 which was my soundtrack during the worst of the pandemic. I was never a fan of hers but I am now a convert. I am listening to her sad songs again to remind me of that time I was brave. This time around, though, I\u2019m stocking up more frozen pizzas and buying fewer cans of beef stew.\nThis time. This time I won\u2019t wipe down my groceries with disinfectant wipes. This time is not the last time.\nThe twelve essays in this short collection were written during late winter and early spring of 2020. The title of each scene is the date it was published. I wrote dozens of essays during the pandemic for my blog Humungus, which was both a job and a coping mechanism. I did my best to stick to writing about pop culture and politics but the growing COVID-19 crisis crept into my work. I chose a nine-week period which reveals, slowly, the intensity of that particular part of the timeline. I edited these selections for typos and tightened a few paragraphs here and there but otherwise, I left them as they were written, in a hurry, scared, scattershot, and clear-eyed.\nJust a few scenes. Essays about quarantine, and movies, and muddling through. They\u2019re reminders of what was so that what is right now doesn\u2019t seem so overwhelming. We will get through this. In the meantime, wear a mask when asked, get vaccinated, please, love your friends and family, and eat your favorite foods, now, while you have the time.",
    "I lost two students last month.\nNot students who are currently enrolled in my class, although I have experienced that particular sort of devastation. No, these students were in my class several years ago. My kids. Any teacher will tell you that this is how it works.\nWhen a student comes into my classroom, I tell them they have a lifetime warranty on their experience as my student. Struggling in college? Call. Need a reference? Email. Want to meet up for an in-person pep-talk? Text.\nMany do.\nI\u2019ve attended college graduations and weddings and baby showers and birthday parties to celebrate them. I\u2019ve held their brand new babies. I\u2019ve let toddlers waddle across the colored tiles in my classroom as their parents fill me in on their adult lives. I\u2019ve met them for brunches, lunches, dinners, and coffees. I\u2019ve scheduled their appointments with therapists and talked them through post-college crises.\nI tell them to call. Many do.\nThe ones who don\u2019t are the ones who linger in my mind. They\u2019re the ones I wonder about on some random cloudy afternoon as I drive down Interstate 5, my mind wandering to the crystal-clear centers of otherwise foggy memories: the stickers they carefully arranged on their water bottle or the playfully doodled notes they left on their assignments or the tears they shed as they sat in my classroom and cried over a break-up.\nIn sixteen years of teaching, I have yet to be able to convey the depth of the care I feel for my students. Every day they sit in front of me, vulnerable in their roles as learners, trusting me to guide them in a manner that will make them feel valued and capable. It\u2019s the greatest responsibility of my life.\nI just wish they knew.\nI wish they knew that I root for them as I grade their essays.\nI wish they knew that I see their pain on a bad day, the pain they try to hide behind a hoodie, and I cross my fingers, hoping that the next time I see them, the hood will be down and the smile will be back.\nI wish they knew that I see them vying for acceptance every day, earnestness sparking quietly in their eyes, even as they work so heartbreakingly hard to make it seem like they don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks.\nI wish they knew how often they make me laugh \u2014 even when I have to hide it.\nI wish they knew just how much they\u2019re capable of accomplishing \u2014 especially when they have resigned themselves to the fate of being \u201cbad\u201d in school.\nI wish they knew how much I love the notes they leave for me \u2014 on assignments, on the whiteboard, and on post-its. The crooked smiley faces and the silly jokes are fuel for another day.\nI wish they knew that I carry their successes and failures with me long after the final bell of the day.\nI wish they knew that I cross my fingers and toes for them on graduation day. That I hope post-high school life is everything they hope it will be and more. That if I could pave the road they\u2019re about to travel to glass-like smoothness, I would. But I can\u2019t and I know it\u2019s for the best.\nI wish my students knew how much I think about them after they leave me. I wish they knew how proud I am when they become mothers, fathers, teachers, nurses, lawyers, mechanics, firefighters, baristas, artists, welders, problem-solvers, soul-searchers, world-travelers, or whatever it is that fills them with a sense of their own tremendous worth.\nI try to tell them these things\u2014 explicitly first \u2014 and then through my actions. I talk to them every single day. I try to cultivate silly little inside jokes with them. I tell them I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve come to class \u2014 even when they\u2019re 30 minutes late. I invite them to stay after school if they need help \u2014 or just a quiet place to work. I encourage them to join the clubs I advise, and I tell them I miss them on the days that they\u2019re gone.\nI lost two students last month. Gone forever. Two truncated sentences in what should have been two full-length stories of vivacity and accomplishment.\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if they knew the richness they added to my life.\nI hope they did.",
    "The internet is a horn of cornucopia overflowing with mostly harmless self-help advice from aspiring gurus. Drink water. Yup, sure, can\u2019t hurt. Go for walks. I get my 10,000 steps in every day. Try to get eight hours of sleep every night. It\u2019s hard because I do love scrolling in bed at night, but yes, when I get a full night\u2019s rest I\u2019m usually less of a blob the next morning.\n\nThe advice is almost always obvious and well-intentioned, I guess. Self-help gurus are like scam artists with good hearts. Eat vegetables? Read books? On it. There are life coaches who share wisdom like \u201cset a goal\u201d as if that\u2019s a secret they\u2019re only sharing with thousands of their closest confidants. Yes, by all means, set goals. One of them should be to ignore anything called a \u201cproductivity hack.\u201d\n\nMy favorite kind of advice though is about building good habits. I can\u2019t get enough. How did you start running? How did you quit eating sugar? Tell me: how do you wake up at 6 am?\n\nThere is a popular myth that it takes 21 days to create a habit and that\u2019s largely debunked. It can take one person a week and another two months to perfect a new personal ritual.\n\nMe? It took about four months and now I can\u2019t stop calling friends up on the phone and talking to them for hours about movies and feelings and politics and feelings. I have standing weekly calls with a couple of friends who live far away from New York City. I have one monthly call with a friend who I\u2019ve known since high school. I call friends out of the blue, and now they\u2019re starting to do the same with me.\n\nI still see friends in the flesh. I go to the movies and then afterward, eat slices of pizza in parks with them. I hang out with their kids. I am as social as I can be.\n\nI was wrong about podcasts, a few years ago I declared them a fad. I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone choosing to listen to the radio in the digital age but I was wrong. Hoo-boy, was I wrong? What I totally didn\u2019t get was how intimate it is to invite a tiny voice into your head. It\u2019s less passive than I thought it would be. I\u2019m able to concentrate on other tasks but I can also get lost in storytelling or long-form interview podcasts.\n\nI\u2019ve started listening to podcasts because I enjoy long walks with my one-eyed mix Shih-Tzu Morley Safer \u2014 who is the color of Golden Grahams cereal \u2014 but I\u2019ve also started talking to friends on those walks. Handsfree. Technology!\n\nI do not believe there were any silver linings to the pandemic, it remains a nightmare and I wish it had never happened. But, I suppose, the pandemic did force me to call friends because having to perform on zoom was exhausting and texting is fine, just fine, but after a while, all the texts bleed into one long boring e.e. cummings poem titled \u201cu ok?\u201d\n\nIt is my understanding that younger generations are terrified of the phone. They prefer texting or DMing or video. But I don\u2019t think my newly rediscovered love of talking on the phone can only be enjoyed by those of us who grew up with landlines. My house in the 80s had one phone and it would ring loudly out of nowhere and when you said \u201chello\u201d you had no idea who was on the other line. It was terrifying unless it was your best friend, and then it was a tiny Christmas.\n\nOne of my regular phone calls is my friend Yvonne, a therapist in Vancouver who I\u2019ve known for almost thirty years. I met her in college and we became immediate friends, she is gentle and fierce and absolutely hilarious. She was also the first biracial person I\u2019d ever really met. Her mom is white, German-born and her dad is Black and her late maternal grandmother was raised in Germany during the war. I met her a couple of times and she was adorable.\n\nYvonne knew what it was like to walk around with a mother who didn\u2019t share her skin color and to see how society treats her based on that. I grew up thinking I was alone, that I was the only person who looked different from their own flesh and blood. We use to talk all night, smoking cigarettes, planning how to take over the world.\n\nWhen I moved to New York City a quarter of a century ago, Yvonne was my first call, on a payphone, because she had moved here a few months prior and was living at a hostel for young women that would not allow any men to visit. We spent years being broke together and making art. She eventually moved to Canada for love and stayed because Canada is like America with lower blood pressure. I protested the move, of course, but also wished her well.\n\nShe and I had grown apart the past few years. There was no reason for this, we both had busy lives. But one day I was thinking about her. About how she made me feel less alone once upon a time. I reached out. Called her up. That\u2019s that. BFFs.\n\nSo here\u2019s some self-help advice: call your friends or family on the phone. Besties, siblings, mom or dad. Plan it or surprise them. Talk about the weather or really get into it.\nThanks to therapy, I\u2019ve learned to be more open with those I love. I don\u2019t dump my feelings on them but I\u2019m more likely now, in my old age, to tell a friend about my insecurities. I\u2019ve also become a better listener, I hunger for stories about kids and jobs and hopes. My calls are full of laughter and secrets, cheers and whispers. I walk around New York City and talk to the people most important to me in my life while my dog hunts for who knows what.",
    "I would like to dismiss 2021 as a terrible, no-good, very bad year, a year to be sept away and forgotten as quickly as possible. After all, it was a year that began with the insurrection and was quickly followed by my ALS diagnosis. Dire on both the public and private fronts. Such a year can\u2019t possibly have been anything other than bad. And yet \u2014 it was also the year that I not only had a new book published, I also sold two new books (on the same day!) to come out in 2022. More importantly, it was a year in which I connected in a deeply heartfelt way with so many friends, old and new, near and far. So, as is so often the case with not only years, but life experiences in general, 2021 was a mixed bag.\nStill, I feel a need for a cleansing ritual as 2021 comes to a close, an acknowledgment that some things must be cleared away to make way for what comes next. I have a friend and a sister both of whom are avid sweepers. They take their brooms to the floor with such determination and ferocity it is almost scary \u2014 you would not want to be a crumb in their paths. I would trust both of them to sweep out the toxins of 2021 and prepare a clean slate for us going forward. I\u2019ll let you know if they rent out their services.\nWhen my husband and I moved, sixteen years ago, to the house where we currently live, neighbors eyed us warily then came over to check us out. They were amazingly direct about hoping we were good people, because the residents who preceded us were definitely not. Those people had harassed the African American kid across the street. They had amassed piles of glass-laden junk that they expected Goodwill to cart away. They irked the postwoman, the utility person, the telephone guy. Everyone had a story of malfeasance. They were all relieved this extended family had moved out.\nSeveral people suggested a saging ceremony was in order, and I, as a lover of ritual, thought why not. So we obtained some sage and burned it in a short ceremony in which we said some words about hoping to made the atmosphere of the property more positive and loving. It seems to have worked, as all traces of the former residents\u2019 bad juju seem to have disappeared, and our years here have been happy, including very enjoyable and mutually helpful relationships with our neighbors.\nSweeping and saging are both great rituals to take us over the threshold into 2022. It is, of course, a completely arbitrary crossing, but because we, as human beings, are meaning makers, it doesn\u2019t feel that way, much as we (I) often try to tell ourselves that the celebration of a new year is manufactured. Why do we do this crazy celebrating with drunkenness and resolutions we know we won\u2019t make good on? Because, I think, a new year gives hope a new platform. The things we hope and wish for seem to have a greater likelihood of coming to pass in the shiny new year than they did in the nasty old one.\nWhen I met my now-husband, he had been reading the Tao Te Ching, and he wanted to warn me about the dangers of hope (the hope of being published was then in our sightlines). The Tao Te Ching warns us against the danger and fallacy of hope. \u201cHope is as hollow as fear,\u201d says the Stephen Mitchell translation. Or, as my husband put it, \u201cHope is the flip side of despair.\u201d The Tao eschews hope because of its relationship to selfhood which is reputed to be the cause of human suffering. To hope sets us up for disappointment.\nAfter many years of thinking about this, and weighing the pros and cons of hope, I would humbly take issue with this Taoist point of view. I think most human beings need hope to carry on through life\u2019s plentiful challenges. We need to feel that our lives, and the world in general, might improve. Without hope the motivation for doing much, beyond going to work, would quickly dissipate. Why exercise if you don\u2019t hope to improve your health. Why do volunteer work if you don\u2019t hope that someone will benefit. Hope has been a powerful force in the accomplishments of so many great liberation movements. Women and blacks would not have achieved the right to vote were it not for some people with very strong hope. People dared to hope, as Barack Obama knew. We need to hope without getting attached to specific outcomes, but we can\u2019t give up on the entire idea of hope, which is endlessly renewable.\nJanuary is named for the Roman god Janus, guardian of doorways and transitions, who is depicted with two faces, one looking forward and one looking back. It\u2019s almost impossible not to do both at this time of year, reflecting back to sweep out the horrors of 2021, and looking ahead with hope for better things in 2022.\nAs I try to expunge the bad juju of the insurrection and my diagnosis, I am keenly involved in looking ahead with hope and optimism: I\u2019m hoping to be alive and mobile when my books come out in August and September, I\u2019m hoping to get to Denver to see my grandniece after she is born in February, I am hoping to hold onto my manual dexterity for the continued writing of fiction and this blog, I am hoping Congress passes the voting rights bills, I am hoping to continue communicating with as many friends as possible. And finally, I am hoping I can make peace with whatever of these hopes don\u2019t materialize.\nI wish you all a smooth transition as you sweep and sage and make the most of hope.",
    "hen a loved one asked me today which Covid-19 vaccine booster shot is best, my reply echoed what many scientists will say: We don\u2019t yet know for sure which brand of booster might best protect against omicron and other variants, but each offers a crucial boost in protection \u2014 even if you mix and match \u2014 amid waning effectiveness of your initial vaccination after a few months, so consider getting the one that\u2019s available.\nWhile that may sound vague, it reflects the available evidence and advice from top health agencies and other experts.\nMeanwhile, time is of the essence for booster shots, as the fast-spreading omicron variant of Covid-19 has ignited fresh spikes in new cases across the country and around the world, a scenario expected to get worse as people travel extensively and gather indoors for the holidays.\nQuestions remain on exactly how dangerous or deadly omicron will be. While preliminary reports suggest it may be less virulent, it will be weeks before the full extent of hospitalizations and deaths can be analyzed.\n\u201cFeels safe to say we\u2019re going to see record numbers of cases in many regions,\u201d says Natalie Dean, PhD, an epidemiologist and assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. \u201cAs for hospitalizations, there are some signs pointing to milder disease, but still. A huge rise in cases is daunting for our weakened health care systems.\u201d\nEffectiveness wanes\nIt\u2019s not yet known exactly how effective existing vaccines and booster shots will be against omicron. Early signs suggest none of them work as well as they have against other variants. Yet vaccines remain an important layer of protection, especially when fortified with a booster shot.\nOne example of the preliminary and evolving knowledge on this: Research that\u2019s not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal suggests effectiveness against infection of the omicron variant from the two-shot Pfizer vaccine fell to around 40% after four months. \u201cThat\u2019s not great, but note that 40% is far better than zero,\u201d points out Francis Collins, MD, PhD, director of the National Institutes of Health. And the really good news: Booster shots lift effectiveness back up to around 80%. \u201cThat\u2019s not quite as high as for delta, but certainly an encouraging result,\u201d Collins says.\nA separate new study published today, also not yet peer-reviewed, indicates the Moderna vaccine is less effective against omicron than it was against the delta variant, but that the booster shot improves omicron protection.\nImportantly, Covid-19 vaccines and boosters are known to lessen disease severity and the risk of death if a person does catch the disease.\n\u201cOur booster vaccine regimens work against omicron,\u201d Anthony Fauci, MD, chief medical adviser to the president and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said today. \u201cAt this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster.\u201d\nWhich means if you are eligible for a booster, don\u2019t wait for vaccines to be potentially tweaked to target omicron or other variants. In fact, the rapid spread of omicron only strengthens the case for getting a booster shot, health officials say.\nBut should you mix and match or stick with the one you got initially? The short answer: sure.\nPersonal preference plays a role\nIt\u2019s okay to mix and match the three approved U.S. vaccines \u2014 Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson \u2014 according to an October decision from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was before the big omicron outbreaks, but there\u2019s been no change in advice since.\n\u201cEmergence of the omicron variant further emphasizes the importance of vaccination, boosters and prevention efforts needed to protect against Covid-19,\u201d CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, said earlier this month.\n\u201cYou can mix and match brands,\u201d echoes a recently updated booster-shot information site at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nThe CDC and other health experts say personal preference can play a role in selecting a booster brand. Paul Hunter, MD, a professor of medicine at the U.K.\u2019s University of East Anglia, goes so far as to suggest two brands over the competition:\n\u201cUnless there are strong reasons not to use them (such as having had a severe allergic reaction or other side effect previously), Pfizer or Moderna are the preferred options,\u201d Hunter writes December 13 in The Conversation. \u201cThese are the mRNA vaccines, which appear to be more effective as a booster dose compared to other Covid-19 vaccines, such as AstraZeneca.\u201d\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine is not approved for use in the United States but is used elsewhere.\n\u201cIf your first two vaccines don\u2019t end up being the same as your booster, this is okay,\u201d Hunter writes. \u201cVarious studies (some awaiting review) have found that mixing doses is safe and leads to a strong immune response \u2014 even if you initially had the AstraZeneca vaccine.\u201d\nBottom line: Vaccines and booster shots \u2014 whichever brand you can get \u2014 remain vital elements in the suite of protective layers that include masks, indoor ventilation and air filtration, and avoiding indoor crowds. I got my booster today. I chose Moderna because 1) it\u2019s the one I had initially with no serious side effects; and 2) it was the one that was available at my local pharmacy.",
    "How to Get Over Homesickness While Abroad | GoAbroad.com\nWhy am I so homesick? Help me?\n\nYour first week or so abroad you\u2019re flying high. Nothing can touch you! Everything is new and amazing. You find yourself dodging worried texts from mom and courtesy-liking every \u201cSO JEALOUS\u201d Instagram comment. Then, as things start to slow down and life becomes more routine it starts to creep in. \n\n\nHomesickness. That mixed heaviness and tightness in your chest when you want to share that last bite of dessert with your best friend, but they\u2019re oceans away. When you just want a hug from mom after a long day volunteering. Or, when you just need a break from all things new and different. \n\nBeing homesick is totally normal. We\u2019d go so far to say that even pro travelers like Rick Steves feel homesick from time to time. But, what can you do to make sure that you don\u2019t get caught in a \u201cfeeling homesick funk?\u201d What's the secret of how to get over homesickness so you can be back to your old self again ASAP?\n\nWe asked a few of our own meaningful travel pros for their best tips and tricks for how to get rid of homesickness when you\u2019re missing home, including specific ways to deal with homesickness while on the road. Watch the video or read the transcript below\u2014then kick homesickness to the curb.\n\nHow lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.\u201d  - Winnie the Pooh\nHi everyone, my name is Rosa. Hi, my name is Broc. My name is Ben Brower. I\u2019m Jade Lansing. I\u2019m Kate Mosser, and I\u2019ve been a meaningful traveler since I was 16. Twenty countries later and I\u2019m still as obsessed as ever. \n\nHow to get rid of homesickness\nHomesickness was more than missing my friends and family\u2014 although that was definitely a part of it. It\u2019s going to be different for everybody. And, for someone who has actually lived in quite a few countries and cities, I thought I was immune to homesickness, but in fact that wasn\u2019t the case at all. For me, being homesick would always build up. \n\nThere\u2019s a separation between what all the people around you are feeling and where your heart really is. You\u2019re neither here, nor there. You\u2019re not home, but you\u2019re also not fully invested where you\u2019re at either, and it\u2019s this weird kind of limbo. I\u2019ve seen people feel depressed, or have a lack of energy. Really just wishing I could share some of these awesome experiences with my people back home. It\u2019s not always an easy thing, sometimes you just miss your family. And then, knowing that there was no way you were ever really going to be able to relay these experiences to the people that you care most about. \n\n6 ways to deal with homesickness\nMostly, for me, bouts of homesickness go away on their own, but for others action needs to be taken... so here's how to cure homesickness.\n\n1. Focus on the positive.\nI try to focus on the positive aspects of wherever I am. Remember, you\u2019re there for a short time. Whether it\u2019s three months, six months, or one year, it will go by in a blink. Sometimes, you need to take a step back and realize exactly where you are. Enjoy the differences that might be the reason that you\u2019re feeling homesick.  \n\n2. Don\u2019t call home too often. \nDON\u2019T CALL HOME EVERY TIME YOU MISS THEM! My mother disagrees with this, but trust me. Honestly, it\u2019s so true. When you\u2019re constantly on Skype and totally investing your energy back home, you miss out on so much in your new country. But, at the same time\u2026 \n\n3. Keep in touch (because mom misses you). \nDon\u2019t ignore your friends and family back home. Keep in contact with them; they miss you, too! Sometimes a call to friends and family is all you need when you\u2019re missing home.\n\n4. Make new friends abroad. \nThere are friends from all around the world who have come to the same place as you, for the same reason. Family and friends, they can be supportive, but they don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to feel homesick. Remember, they [your new friends] are most likely experiencing the same thing that you are (missing home!), and they need you just as much as you need them. So, who better to talk about what just happened in that very-strange-cultural-different moment, than the person who just went through it with you? This is a great strategy when you\u2019re feeling homesick.\n\n5. Write out your feels. \nKeep a journal! My journal sucks if I want to remember what I was doing every day, but it\u2019s great for reminding myself that feelings are not permanent. Make a list of all the things you miss about home and then, right next to it, make a list of all the things you\u2019ve learned since you left. There will be good days and not so good days.  \n\n6. Treat yo\u2019self to a \"day off.\"\nTake a break if you need it. I give myself permission to take the day off. I treat myself to comfort food, and write postcards to the people around the world that feel like home to me. NOW who\u2019s missing home?!\n\nMissing Home? Heres How to Stop Feeling Homesick FOR REAL\nWhen you're missing home, hang in there\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy. Keep fighting the good fight, my friend. Just know that home is totally going to be there for you when you get back. Go out, explore, make friends, breathe in that country smell that you will probably never have the time to do ever again. Embrace the newness around you and make it a part of you. \n\nChoosing to invest in a life abroad means you\u2019re creating a second home across the globe that someday, you\u2019ll no doubt be homesick for, too. You\u2019re the one that will have changed. Home grows wider to encompass all of the people who have nourished you on your travels. And, you\u2019ll have so much more to share with your friends and family when you do get back home. \n\nTake that, homesickness!",
    "Question: Why did my check engine light come on after I replaced some fuses?\n\nAnswer: Likely one of these situations occurred:\n\n1. You replaced a fuse with a fuse of an incorrect value. Double check that you used the correct type of fuse per the vehicle's manual.\n\n2. One of the fuses you inserted is bad or quickly went bad after installation, causing one of the systems in your vehicle to stop working correctly.\n\n3. You replaced a bad fuse, causing a system in your vehicle that was not working previously to start working. That system has an issue causing your vehicle to display the check engine light. This is less likely if the check engine light wasn't on before this.\n\n4. It's a coincidence and another system in your car started to experience an issue just after you replaced the fuse. Believe it or not, this does happen even though it is also less likely.\n\nThe easiest way to narrow down the problem is to use an OBD 2 reader, such as the one I linked to in the article, to read the trouble codes from your car's computer. You can then cross reference this code online or with the manual that comes with the reader to find out exactly which system is causing your car's check engine light to illuminate.\n\nQuestion: Can I get rid of the \"check engine\" light without an onboard diagnostic reader?\n\nAnswer: You certainly can, but it may be more difficult. I would start by trying the other methods outlined in this article. If those don't work, then there is likely something mechanically wrong with the vehicle.\n\nIt can be as simple as replacing an easy to reach $10 sensor that has gone bad, or much more difficult. While some expert mechanics can troubleshoot their vehicle and locate the issue without the assistance of an OBD reader, most people (such as myself) need a code reader to make things easier for us.\n\nA code reader can help you by manually allowing you to clear the fault code that has caused the check engine light to illuminate (in case it was stuck on due to an error in the car's computer), or if there truly is something mechanically wrong then it can give you the \"error code\" that your car is producing.\n\nThis error code is the actual reason the check engine light has been activated. You can then look up this error code in the reader's manual or online and see what the issue is with your vehicle in plain English. It is a handy tool that even most expert mechanics quite heavily rely on these days.\n\nQuestion: I replaced my vehicle's O2 sensor, disconnected and reconnected the battery multiple times, and even changed its plugs, yet the check engine light came back on after a 45 km drive.

    "Unclogging a kitchen sink drain is often much easier than most people think, and avoiding the cost of calling out a plumber is always a good thing in my experience. While you may need to invest some time and effort fixing the problem yourself, it's usually worth it.\n\nMost clogs can be resolved by employing some relatively simple and straightforward techniques and tools. Once you have unclogged the sink, it is then time to work on minimizing the chances of the problem reoccurring - see the section at the end of the article for advice on prevention.\n\n8 Ways to Unclog a Kitchen Sink Drain\nRemove all standing water.\nCheck the garbage disposal (if you have one).\nUse a plunger to dislodge the clog.\nClean the P-trap.\nUse a plumbers\u2019 snake (also sometimes called a \"toilet jack\" or an \"electric eel\").\nUse baking soda and vinegar (the natural alternative to chemicals)\nUse cleaning chemicals.\nCall a plumber.\nIn my experience, unclogging a kitchen sink drain can require a combination of more than one of these methods.\n\nThe whole process could take you anywhere from ten minutes to more than an hour to clear a clogged drain, depending on the nature of the blockage. The job can be messy and care must be used if chemicals are involved, as splashes can burn skin or worse.\n\nApart from calling a plumber, most of my suggestions are relatively inexpensive or cost nothing\u2014they use tools and materials you should already have in your house. Below, I will go into more detail about each method.\n\nA clogged kitchen sink drain requires urgent action. Blockages can be caused by a variety of things, but typically involve foods such as coffee grinds, fat from meats such as bacon, and starchy foods like rice and pasta.\n1. Remove All Standing Water From the Clogged Kitchen Sink\nStanding water happens when water has continued to run into the sink after the clog has occurred. You should put on your rubber gloves and bail out the excess water with a jug, cup, or other container, so that you have clear access to the drain. Then you should should clear what waste you can in and around the drain by hand.\n\nIf there is a garbage disposal do not put your hand or fingers near the blades (see #2 below). Sometimes clearing the waste by hand can be all it takes to fix the problem, but more often it takes further action.\n\n2. Check the Garbage Disposal\nIf your kitchen sink has a garbage disposal, then you will need to check it for clogs. They can easily get blocked up with bits of food. To determine the source of the clog, switch off the disposer first. If you stick anything down the drain, then you will also want to switch off the power.\n\nYou can use a flashlight to look down the drain and try to determine the nature of the blockage: where it is and what is causing it. This will determine your tools and approach.\n\nThe likeliest cause of the clog is pieces of food that are stuck between the blades\u2014if it is something more substantial or valuable, such as jewelry, then you may wish to call a plumber. If it is food, try breaking up the debris by manually turning the disposer blades.\n\nThe manual operator is normally at the bottom of the disposer and is operated with an Allen key. Refer to disposer manual for full instructions.\n\nUse pliers to remove any loose food debris. If the disposer is still clogged, then you will need to use a plunger. It may be possible to remove the disposer entirely for inspection. Be sure to pinch any connections to dishwasher first, however.\n\nDon't use chemical cleaners with a disposer as these can cause it damage. If the problem turns out not to be the disposer or you don't have one fitted, you will need to explore other methods.\n\nCaution\n\nNever stick your hand inside the garbage disposer, as the blades are sharp and can cause serious injury.\n\n3. Use a Plunger\nThere are three types of plungers: the classic flat-bottom sink plunger, the accordion plunger, and the toilet plunger, which has an additional bell-end at the bottom. You are better off using a flat-bottomed plunger for this job.\n\nHow to Unclog Your Kitchen Sink Drain Using a Plunger\nRun a few inches of water into the sink to aid suction and begin plunging.\nIf you have a garbage disposer, try running it again afterward. Be careful not to overheat the disposer, as that can cause damage.\nRun some water into the sink. If it drains okay, then you're all set.\nIf it doesn't run, then you will have to plunge some more or move onto another method.\n4. Clean the P-trap\nThe P-trap is the elbow-shaped pipe under the sink. If this gets clogged with food and/or grease, then you may want to take it apart and clean out the gunk that is causing the blockage.\n\nHow to Clean the Kitchen Sink P-trap\nBefore you start, make sure that you have a bucket placed under the P-trap to catch the water that is backed up in your sink.\nYou will then need to unscrew the connections to the pipe and wall.\nRemove the P-trap and inspect it for debris.\nIf the blockage is not in the P-trap, then you will need to try unblocking the drain with a plumbing snake.\nIf the clog is further down your drain, you may want to use a plumbing snake to dislodge whatever it is clogging your sink.\n\n5. Use a Plumbers\u2019 Snake\nIf neither plunging nor cleaning the P-trap works, you may need to use a plumber's snake to get rid of the clog.\n\nThis tool consists of a coiled spiral snake, typically around 1/4-inch thick, with a handle at one end. The coil is used to reach down into the drain, and then the handle is cranked, dislodging and pulling up the clog. Some snakes are manually cranked, while others are electrically powered for extra strength.\n\nYou Can Use a Wire Coat Hanger If You Don't Have a Snake\nIf you don't have a plumbing snake on hand, you can also use a wire coat hanger to fish out the clog. This is a cheap, easy method that almost anyone can do\u2014all you need is a wire coat hanger and a pair of pliers.\n\nUnwind the wire looped around the neck of the hook and straighten out the hanger as much as possible. You might have to use pliers to do this.\nUse the pliers to create a small, one-inch-long hook at one end of the wire. Make sure it is narrow enough to fit through the drain.\nInsert the hooked end of the wire down the drain and gently wiggle it around a bit, trying to find the clog. Do not push down too roughly, as this might push the blockage further down the pipe.\nIf you feel anything at the end of the wire, pull it up and out of the drain. You might not be able to remove the whole clog all at once, so try again to see if anything else comes up. Turn on the hot water from your faucet to make sure you got everything.\nIf you try this trick and fail to find the blockage, it could be that the clog is further down the drain than the wire is able to reach. In this case, try one of the other methods listed in this article.\n\n6. Use Baking Soda and Vinegar\nThis method avoids the use of chemical cleaners. All you need is one cup of baking soda and one cup of vinegar.\n\nHow to Unclog Your Kitchen Sink Drain Using Baking Soda and Vinegar\nFirst, pour boiling water down the drain. Then push the baking soda down the sink drain, using a spatula if necessary. Allow it to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.\nNext, pour vinegar into the drain. Put the stopper into the sink, pushing the vinegar toward the clog and blocking off the mixture from coming back up.\nFinally, flush the drain with boiling water again.\nThis method doesn't always work, but it is worth trying.\n\nBaking soda and vinegar in combination can sometimes work when it comes to unblocking clogs. The baking soda is added first, followed by the vinegar. The stopper should then be pushed in to contain the resulting reaction.\n7. Should I Use Chemicals, Such as Drano, to Unclog My Kitchen Sink?\nIf your sink has a garbage disposer, I would seriously recommend that you do NOT use a chemical cleaner, as they can ruin the blades and spray back into your sink.\n\nI would also NOT recommend using a liquid chemical cleaner if you have a complete clog rather than just a problem with slow draining. Whenever you use chemicals there is always a chance that the the toxic chemicals will become backed up in the sink, along with stagnant water, and cause a potential health hazard.\n\nThe type of cleaner you get can depend on the type of matter you suspect may be causing the clog. Generally speaking, clogs caused by biological matter require a more acidic cleaner, whereas greasy clogs are better dealt with by using alkaline cleaners.\n\nAlways read the label carefully and use the cleaner exactly as instructed. Chemical cleaners can be harmful if misused.\n\n8. Call a Plumber\nIf the above methods fail to work, or you believe that the problem is simply out of your league, then you should call a professional plumber. This is the least affordable option, but it can save time and trouble when nothing seems to work and you don't want to start messing around with the plumbing.\n\nThe cost of a plumber can range from $175 to $450 depending on how long the job takes to fix, so be sure to try the other options first if you're price sensitive. If you're not worried about the cost, however, it may be the least troublesome to just get someone else to fix the problem.\n\nA clogged kitchen sink drain can bring a household to a virtual standstill. Most clogs can be dealt with using common household items; however, if none of these work, you may have to call a plumber\nThe Main Symptoms of a Clogged Sink Drain\nThe first problem that you are likely to notice is slow drainage: When you turn on the faucet, the water will be slow to go down the drain. After a time, if this is not resolved, the water will begin to back up and drainage may eventually stop altogether. Therefore, the sooner that you can unclog your sink, the better.\n\nStanding water is unhygienic, makes things messy, and can make it more difficult to ascertain the nature of the blockage.\n\nWhat Causes a Kitchen Sink Drain to Become Clogged?\nIf your kitchen sink has a garbage disposer, it's very probable that the food residue from washing dishes caused your clog. Although most food types are in theory capable of causing clogs, there are some foods that are much worse offenders than others. Rather than putting them down the garbage disposer, it's a much better idea to compost them, throw them away, or otherwise dispose of them responsibly.\n\nFoods that can cause clogs include:\nMeat or grease (such as bacon fat) which can coagulate and then catch other foods.\nCoffee grounds, which can form into hard, compressed lumps if not properly drained.\nStarchy foods, such as rice, potatoes, pasta.\nHigh fiber foods, such as certain greens, corn husks, and celery.\nBones from meat and poultry.\nBanana peels and pits from fruits such as mangos, plums, peaches, and apricots.\nBesides food, there are plenty of other things that might inadvertently cause your kitchen sink to become clogged, such as napkins, paper towels, medications, food wrappers, bottle tops, hair, or jewelry.\n\nWill Bleach Unclog the Sink Drain?\nMy advice is to NOT attempt to use bleach to clear the clog.\n\nFirstly, bleach is a very toxic substance that can cause all sorts of issues, including reacting with other substances inside the pipes.\n\nSecondly, although a cup of bleach poured down the drain, followed by some some hot water might sanitize a blockage and reduce bad smells, it won't do much to break up the grease, food matter and other things that generally cause clogs in a kitchen sink.\n\nCan Coca Cola Unclog a Drain?\nCoca cola is caustic, so in theory tipping a bottle of this soda down the drain could potentially clear a clog. Some people swear by this method. However, in my experience, the success rate virtually zero - it is not as good as baking soda and vinegar, and certainly nowhere near as effective as commercial cleaners.\n\nHow to Prevent a Kitchen Sink Drain From Clogging?\nPrevention is almost always better than cure, of course, so it's important that you don't abuse your drain. Be sure not to allow the foods listed above down your drain.\n\nHowever, issue can and do happen, so you may also wish to invest in a good sink strainer to stop the sink drain from getting clogged up with food pieces (see below for my recommendation).\n\nIt's also wise to have some basic tools on hand, such as:\n\nAs mentioned above, a plumbing snake or drain auger can be a very useful tool to have around too. It can be used not just for sinks but also for unclogging shower drains. And, in case none of these methods work, it wouldn't hurt to have the name and number of your local plumber on hand.\n\nWhat's the Best Sink Strainer For Preventing Clogs?\nThere are many great products out there that can reduce the amount of clog-forming debris that goes down your drain, but if you want me to highlight just one it would be the Oxo Good Grips Silicone Sink Strainer.\n\nThe features I like about this strainer include:\n\nIt does its job effectively, catches the sink debris before it can enter the drain and clog things up.\nIt's very easy to clean. The nature of its job means that it collects lots of waste, but the design means that you can invert it to remove debris when cleaning it by hand. You can also put it in the dishwasher.\nIt's designed to fit well and it strains without interrupting the flow down the drain.\nIt has an attractive appearance and doesn't have a tendency to get stained like can happen with some strainers.\nIt's reasonably priced. I ordered mine online and paid less than nine dollars.",
    "What is Social Media Marketing? A Simple 8-Step Strategy [2021]\n\nSocial media marketing.\n\nIf just reading those words made you want to throw your laptop off of a cliff, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nBetween established social platforms like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and LinkedIn, and the young, up-and-comers like TikTok and Clubhouse, social media content can quickly become all-consuming and overwhelming.\n\nBut whether you work for an established tech company, run a lifestyle blog, or are just looking to sign on more clients for your freelance writing, business social media marketing is an ideal way to connect with your target audience.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do:\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll cover what social media marketing is, why you should bother, and outline a no-stress, 8-step process for building an effective social media marketing strategy.\n\nReady?\n\nLet\u2019s dive in\n\n\nWhat is Social Media Marketing?\nSocial media marketing is the act of using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter,  Instagram, and TikTok to attract and retain leads, customers, and clients.\n\nThere are two main social media strategies: paid social media marketing and organic social media marketing. \n\nAlso called SMM, paid social media marketing is when you pay to place advertisements on the platform to get in front of targeted audiences. This includes Facebook ads, Instagram Story ads, promoted Tweets, TikTok Spark ads, and many other formats.\n\nPaid ads look like this on Facebook. Note the \u201csponsored\u201d tag:\n\nfacebook feed showing a sponsored post\nAdvertising on most social media platforms allows for more precise targeting.\n\nFor example:\n\nYou could target men between the ages of 25 and 45 who live in Tallahassee, Florida, work in healthcare, and like football.\n\nOrganic social media marketing is free. It involves creating and optimizing a business profile or page, sharing interesting content, and engaging with followers.\n\nOrganic social is not a pay-to-play marketing channel, and therefore it tends to grow more slowly than social media advertising. But the ideal social media strategy should include both paid and organic.\n\nThe Benefits of Social Media Marketing\nBy 2025, experts expect 4.41 billion people worldwide will use one social media platform or another.\n\nIf you want to expand your blog or freelance business\u2019 reach and build a relationship with your audience, you can\u2019t ignore social media. These platforms take up the majority of internet users\u2019 browsing time and garnish a lot of our attention.\n\nSocial media can help you:\n\nShare your expertise: Create content about and become a thought leader in your industry, and network with other leaders in your field.\nBuild relationships: 81 percent of consumers buy from brands they trust. Social media marketing makes it easy to build trust by establishing a strong relationship.\nIncrease brand awareness: The average person spends 145 minutes on social media a day, making it an ideal place to get eyes on your brand.\n Speed-up customer service: Today\u2019s consumers expect brands to respond fast. Social media provides a public platform where you can respond to issues and show you care.\nFind more clients: Struggling to find more writing clients? Consistently creating engaging content to share across your social media platforms can help you connect with your ideal clients.\nSocial media has changed how we communicate, meet new friends, and interact with prospective clients.\n\nAnd if you want to grow your business, social media plan should be a major component of your digital marketing strategy.\n\nBut where do you start?\n\nThere are dozens of platforms, hundreds of tools, and plenty of experts willing to take your money to show you how to do it right.\n\nThe good news is, it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. This stress-free 8-step social media success strategy will help you get started.\n\nThe 8-Step Social Success Strategy\nBuilding a social media success strategy starts with choosing the right social media sites. The most popular social media platforms are Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Each has its own audience, rules, and content options.\n\nWe\u2019ll cover how to choose the right platform and then build a strategy below.\n\n1. Set Goals & Establish Key Metrics\nWhat do you want social media marketing to do for your business?\n\nThere are two overall types of goals: business goals and on-site goals. Each goal should have specific, measurable metrics and a time frame.\n\nFor example, you might want to use social media to increase referral traffic to your blog by 15% and gain 1,000 followers in the first six months.\n\nYour overall business goals might include:\n\nDrive traffic to your website\nIncrease brand awareness\nMake sales\nIncrease email sign-ups\nFind leads\nAnd your on-platform social media goals might include:\n\nGain 1,000 followers\nIncrease on-site brand mentions by 24%\nGet 10 reviews\nAfter setting your goals, establish what tools you need to track social media analytics.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf your goal is to increase brand mentions by 24%, you\u2019ll need a social media management tool like Hootsuite to track brand mentions. Followers and reviews can generally be tracked by the social media platform you\u2019re using.\n\n2. Research Your Audience\nIf you already have a target audience or buyer persona, you might be tempted to use that for your social media marketing. That would be a mistake. The way people interact on social media may be different from how they interact via email or your website.\n\nInstead, use that data as a starting point. Who is your ideal audience? Outline their age, family status, location (if relevant), occupation, industry, income level, likes, and dislikes. Use that data to see what platform they are most active on.\n\nFor example, Facebook users stretch across age ranges, making it an ideal place for most brands.\n\nhootsuite chart showing facebook demographics stats\nInstagram users skew older than you might expect, with the largest user base between 25 and 34 years old. Younger users tend to use TikTok, though many older users are moving to that platform as well.\n\nOnce you know where your audience is most active, it\u2019s time to see how other businesses are approaching their social media strategy.\n\n3. Get to Know the Competition\nIf you already have a list of competitors, check them out on the social media platform you\u2019ve selected.\n\nCreate a spreadsheet and add columns for the number of followers, how many times they post, what days they post, types of content, and what content gets the most interaction.\n\nNote that your competitors on social media may be different from your direct competitors. To find your social media competitors, look at what type of content your users share, what brands they interact with, and what groups they join.\n\nUse the search function to find similar brands.\n\nFor example, if I want to grow my tech blog, I might search \u201ctech blog,\u201d then select \u201cpages\u201d to see businesses related to that term:\n\nlist of tech blogs\nThere\u2019s a complete list of brands I\u2019ll want to check out!\n\nDive deep into what is working for your competitors. Do they share Instagram Stories, or go live on Facebook every Friday? What type of content do people respond to? Do they like feel-good stories, news posts, or humorous memes?\n\nTake notes and use this info to guide your social media marketing strategy.\n\n4. Create Accounts & Optimize Profiles\nNow it is time to set up your social media account on whichever platform you\u2019ve decided to use.\n\nThe exact optimization process will vary by platform. However, aim to include as much information as possible.\n\nStart by creating a business profile, which often provides access to additional insights and features. Include crucial information such as:\n\nBusiness name (Use the exact same name as your website or other platforms)\nAddress or location\nPhone number\nEmail\nHours of operation (if you have them)\nWebsite\nA short bio that includes key terms your site targets\nProfile picture, such as a logo\nCover photo\nCategory (such as blog, publication, public figure, etc.)\nDepending on the type of business and platform, you may add details like your groups, music you like, questions, and favorite books.\n\nscreenshot of Neil Patel FB page\n5. Setup a Content Schedule\nLike your content marketing strategy, consistency is key when crafting your social media marketing plan.\n\nBut, trying to come up with clever posts every day can quickly eat up time you could spend elsewhere on your business.\n\nDecide how many times you want to post a week (this is where your competitive research comes in handy!), then create a calendar in Google Cal or Excel and write down what you want to cover. Mix up formats \u2013 for example, you might share a mix of links, photos, and videos to keep your social media posts interesting.\n\nHere\u2019s an example, but feel free to adjust it to fit your business and platform:\n\nMonday: Meet the team: Posts about our editorial team and their background\nTuesday: New blog post: Share top-trafficked post from the last week with an interesting quote.\nWednesday: Industry news: Share an interesting post from a news source/popular industry blog. Include a question to drive engagement\nThursday: Old blog post: Share older but still popular posts with interesting quotes.\nFriday: Funny/humor: Share a funny meme, photo, or story to get people talking.\nMake a note of upcoming holidays or events your audience might care about. For example, a finance writer might mention tax season or the end of the third quarter.\n\nRemember that people are social to be social, so don\u2019t just share posts about your brand. Look for ways to entertain, interact, and start meaningful conversations.\n\n6. Create & Share Great Content\nOnce you have your content schedule set up, it\u2019s time to create and share great content.\n\nKeep in mind, you shouldn\u2019t only be sharing your own content! Connect with others in your industry and aim to share content your audience will find valuable.\n\nHere are a five tips for sharing better content on social media:\n\nMix up formats: Share a mix of videos, pictures, blog posts, etc. Different people like different types of content and some types of content rank better in social algorithms. (Videos tend to do well \u2014 just look at YouTube!)\nSearch hashtags: See what other people are posting about your industry and share content your users will find useful.\nUse Feedly to follow industry news: This app allows you to follow specific industries so you can share content related to your field.\nCreate original content: Use tools like PicMonkey or Canva to create original memes, infographics, and images.\nSchedule content in advance: Use a social media scheduling tool like HootSuite or Buffer so you can schedule posts in advance. Posting every day can quickly become a time suck.\n7. Advertise\nUnfortunately, every social media network uses an algorithm to determine what posts users see organically\u2013and organic reach is falling.\n\nIn 2019, you could expect to reach around 5 percent of your audience with a post; today that same post could reach less than .08% of your followers.\n\nSocial media is pay to play \u2013 but that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Most platforms allow you to carefully target your audience so you only reach those users most likely to like your content and interact with your brand.\n\nFor example:\n\nLinkedIn ads can target an audience based on interests, age, location, family size, gender, and behavior. You can also use retargeting ads to advertise specifically to site visitors.\n\nOn Facebook, you can target lookalike audiences, which share traits with your target audience.\n\nThe details of advertising on each platform are beyond the scope of this article. Still, it\u2019s important to know paid advertising on social media can be incredibly effective at increasing email sign-ups and driving traffic.\n\nLearn about the different types of ads for each platform, what audiences they reach, and make sure to set a small budget before diving in.\n\n8. Observe, Track, & Adapt\nRemember those goals and metrics we set at the beginning? Now\u2019s the time to see how your strategy works.\n\nPost content for at least a month to give you time to gain traction and followers.\n\nThen, use the insights tool from your social platform of choice to see where you stand.\n\nFor example, Facebook Audience Insights shows demographic information and what content performed well. (You can also see Instagram insights here, too.)\n\n\nWhat type of content does well? Aim to post more of that content.\n\nDid you reach your goals? Pay attention to where you fell short and choose another strategy.\n\nFor example, if your goal was to gain 1,000 followers and you fell short, consider creating a paid social media ad to increase followers.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to check Google Analytics to see how many social followers land on your website.  The Acquisition>Social>Network Referral report will show the amount of traffic you\u2019ve driven from social:\n\nscreenshot of google analytics\nThis will help you see how social media is impacting your business as a whole.\n\nFollower count and likes might feel good, but they don\u2019t tell you much about your business. Pay attention to direct metrics as well, such as site traffic, email list subscribers, and sales.\n\nThe Key to Social Media Marketing is Testing\nSocial media marketing isn\u2019t easy \u2013 if it were, everyone would be doing it!\n\nBut this eight-step process will get you started on the right foot. Test to see what type of content your audience responds to and what helps you meet your marketing goals.\n\nSocial media features and new platforms are rolling out every week, so don\u2019t be afraid to take a risk and try something new.",
    "This movie was incredibly charming and fun to watch for me. After the travesty that was \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul\", it was very nice to see a transition away from the live-action formula, especially considering the actors in the first three live action movies being older and the replacements not being as charming.\n\nThe first thing I would like to point out is the animation style. It is incredibly faithful to the style of the books illustrations and for the most part transition well to 3D, though I will say Manny doesn't look to good in this style. Other than that, I love the animation. The story is a bit of a retelling of the first book, which isn't a problem with me (The first book being one of my favorites is also an added bonus for me personally). It has a few extra additions that expand upon the book and never feel out of place. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Greg and Rowley in the movie, as it was charming and in my opinion, feels more real than their relationship in the books. The series trademark humor is here as well, and while nothing made me laugh out loud, I got quite a number of smiles and chuckles out of the script.\n\nHowever, my only problem with the movie is that the runtime is way to short, leading to a lot of things from the first book being skipped over. It was very sad to see the Wizard of Oz plotline not being in the movie, and I feel like a little less than an hour is much less than the movie deserves.\n\nDespite this, I highly enjoyed this movie and I recommend watching it if you are a fan of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series like I am. I give it a solid 8.5/10.",
    "When Greg Heffley begins his last year of middle school, his mother gives him a journal to write and draw in, and this book is the product of that year\u2019s recordings. Greg begins his journal by describing the other students and analyzing middle school popularity, a quality he will seek all year. He tells the story of an old slice of cheese left outside on a basketball court. If someone touches the cheese, they are cursed and ostracized. Greg introduces his older brother, Rodrick, who plays drums in a heavy-metal band and plays merciless tricks on Greg; his younger brother, Manny, who is treated like a prince; and his best friend, Rowley. Greg is \u201csuper good\u201d at video games even though his father is always encouraging him to spend more time outdoors. When Greg uses headphones to listen to Rodrick\u2019s CDs that have parental warning labels, he gets caught and punished with a video-game ban. At school, Greg runs for class treasurer, but his inappropriate posters get thrown in the trash by the vice principal.\n\nIn October, inspired by a haunted house in town, Greg and Rowley build their own haunted house in Rowley\u2019s basement. When one frightened child crawls under the bed, the boys get caught by Rowley\u2019s father, who shuts down the haunted house and grounds Rowley for a week. Later, when Greg and Rowley go trick-or-treating, they get soaked by a group of high schoolers in a truck (known as the Whirley Street Kids). When Greg and Rowley threaten to call the cops, the teenagers chase them. They hide in Greg\u2019s Gramma\u2019s house, but when Greg\u2019s mother insists they come home, Greg\u2019s dad soaks them in the driveway.\n\nIn November, Greg\u2019s physical education teacher announces a unit on wrestling, and the boys are paired by weight, which means that Greg has to wrestle another lightweight boy named Fregley. Greg wants to move up a weight class, so he approaches his parents for a bench press. But they want to wait to purchase one until Christmas. Greg\u2019s mother makes him try out for the school play, The Wizard of Oz, and Greg is cast as a tree. The play ends up being a disaster. As Christmas approaches, Greg asks for the video game Twisted Wizard, and the family buys a red sweater for a Giving Tree program at church. On Christmas morning, Greg receives a bench press, but he doesn\u2019t care about it anymore. By accident, Mom also gives Greg the red sweater meant for the Giving Tree. Greg gives Rowley a L\u2019il Cutie book he got (but hated) for Christmas, and Rowley gives him a child\u2019s Big Wheel. When Greg teases Manny on New Year\u2019s Eve, he gets sent to bed early.\n\nIn January, Greg and Rowley invent a game for the Big Wheel in which Greg throws a football at Rowley as he rides down a hill. Unfortunately, Rowley breaks his hand and gets lots of sympathy and attention at school. Greg signs up for Independent Study, and his class is assigned to build a robot, but the class gets canceled when the boys make a list of all the words that the robot should not say. Greg and Rowley sign up for Safety Patrol to walk kindergarteners home halfway through the day.

    "A lack of sex in relationships can vary from trust issues to health related dysfunction. Sometimes circumstances such as having a new baby or struggling with infertility can throw everything off.  Or maybe you just not know what you like or are struggling with feeling sexually confident. There are moments, however, when the \u201creasons\u201d for the lulls are not as easy to identify and often couples will enter therapy seeking the answers.\n\nImagine a romantic relationship is like a layered cake. Each layer builds off of each other and without one, the entire cake feels incomplete.\n\nThe answer to \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we having sex?\u201d can often involve a missing ingredient(s) somewhere within the layered cake.  Here are the layers:\n\nThe first layer is the foundation, which is friendship. This could entail respect, kindness, fun, commonalities, trust and appreciation.\nThe second layer is emotional connectedness that is more intimate than with a friendship. Maybe this entails emotional vulnerability, compassion and understanding. It can include feel seen, validated and reassured by your partner.\nThe third layer is nonsexual physical intimacy. This can include flirtatious love taps, long kisses, hugs and overall affection.\nThe top layer is sexual intimacy. This can include foreplay, erotic play and any type of sex play.\nSometimes, couples nurture the layer that comes the easiest to them. These same couples may also focus too heavily on the lack of sex and be really uncertain as to why. As you can see, if you don\u2019t have a strong, respectful and engaging friendship that allows you to feel emotionally safe and non-sexually connected, it is challenging to feel motivated to have sex.  When couples can focus less on sex when they are experiencing a lull and focus more on the other layers of the cake as a whole, sex often develops without much effort.\n\nWhether you are in a longterm relationship or just starting out, you know sex changes; it evolves, it slows down, it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s cold. Sex has moments of passion, lust, spontaneity and even discouragement. No matter what gender, color, age, sexual preferences or history, we all have cycles in our sexual connection to ourselves and each other from time to time.\n\nIf the layered cake is complete, be sure to also pay attention to your attitudes about sex.  Sex positivity allows you to be open to new experiences without guilt, shame, or obligation. When you take ownership of your sexual self and explore your inhibitions, you may uncover a lack of trust or insecurity that is something you need to take a look at. Sex doesn\u2019t have to look any sort of way. It doesn\u2019t have to be labeled as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d it doesn\u2019t have to be done a certain type of way or a certain number of times per week. Being positive about sex can inspire true desire and intimacy between you and your partner, no matter how long you have been together.\n\nOne way to be sex positive is to talk about Sex.  Seems simple, but the more you talk about sex with partner, friends, community, etc, the more you may feel liberated of any stress, assumptions and/or pressures that you may be subconsciously holding onto. Talking about sex helps open the barriers of any sexual taboo(s) and helps to normalize them.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to become aware of what sexual \u201cbaggage\u201d you bring into the bedroom.  We all have baggage! And it doesn\u2019t imply something is wrong with you, but rather it acknowledges that sometimes we have obstacles in our life that hinder us from growing. Maybe you have had sexual trauma; a very strict and/or religious upbringing about gender roles and sex in general; negative past sexual experiences; lack of trust in yourself or your partner; negative body image; etc, etc. Find a sex therapist that may support you through this process.",
    "If you\u2019re a woman in a committed relationship, I\u2019d like you to think about how your husband/partner reacts to you when you\u2019re vulnerable \u2014 do your vulnerabilities bring out the best in him? Or does he react with annoyance, frustration or even anger?\n\nOne wife wanted to share what she learned about her husband after completing six months of couples counseling. As you read Nina\u2019s insights, see if anything she\u2019s discovered applies to your own relationship. Sometimes we can find pearls of wisdom on someone else\u2019s journey, even when the specifics differ.\n\n(I\u2019m handing the blog reins over to Nina at this point so that you can hear from her directly\u2026)\n\nMy husband and I have our differences and we\u2019ve learned to compromise over the years, but overall we have a loving, solid marriage.\n\nHe\u2019s always been quiet. When we met he was a little more talkative, but even then, it paled in comparison to how much I need to communicate. I\u2019ve stopped trying to get him to talk more. It was unfair to him (since he\u2019s never been talkative) and in all honesty, my failed attempts only led me to be more frustrated with him.\n\nAfter fifteen years of marriage and a stint in couples counseling, I\u2019ve learned to appreciate the following about Edward:\n\n\u2666 Dedication and loyalty matter more to him than expressing his feelings;\n\n\u2666 He \u201cshows up\u201d everyday for us by supporting the family and by being a really good listener for me and our three daughters;\n\n\u2666 When he shuts down emotionally it\u2019s because he\u2019s feeling overwhelmed. This is how he copes. I\u2019ve learned not to take this personally. He\u2019s not running away emotionally since he always finds his way back to me when he\u2019s less overwhelmed. I\u2019ve learned to give him his space at these times.\n\n\u2666 And the biggest thing I\u2019ve discovered about my husband is that he takes it personally when I\u2019m upset (even if it has nothing to do with him). Our couples counselor pointed out this pattern. You see, Edward doesn\u2019t necessarily become upset or unhappy for me. Instead he becomes frustrated with me (not all the time, of course, but enough times over the years that it became an issue between us).\n\nThis begs the question: Why would someone who loves you become upset with you when you\u2019re most vulnerable?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see your husband or boyfriend as cruel if/when he gets upset with you in these moments.\n\nBut Edward isn\u2019t cruel. He\u2019s kind, loving and wants to make me happy. Yes, the argument can be made that he is unsympathetic and uncaring if my upset-ness leads him to become frustrated with me. And I\u2019ve told him so\u2014I\u2019ve never been timid about confronting him. But I kept coming back to the question I raised earlier. Considering his caring demeanor, his reaction didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nUnderstanding Your Man: When Protective Love Turns to Helpless Frustration\nOddly enough, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s Edward\u2019s commitment to my happiness that helps explain his negative reactions to my unhappiness. When I\u2019m not happy, in Edward\u2019s mind, he\u2019s let me down. He\u2019s failed to protect me. And if he\u2019s trying his best to comfort and support me (and take away my pain) \u2014 if he\u2019s given his all and I\u2019m still troubled about something \u2014 then he really takes an emotional hit. He feels like a complete failure.\n\nAs our counselor explained, in those moments the man who loves and wants to protect his wife is turned into an ineffectual husband who must now stand by and watch his wife suffer.\n\nBut rather than share his helplessness with me and talk about what he\u2019s truly feeling, things get quickly turned around in his mind and I become the problem. So he can now be angry with me rather than feel like a complete failure. Our counselor said that many men aren\u2019t aware that this is what is actually going on. Edward did say that it sometimes feels like I\u2019m placing obstacles in the way that prevent him from pulling me out of whatever I\u2019m struggling with emotionally. If that\u2019s what he\u2019s thinking, his frustration starts to make sense even though it\u2019s unfounded.\n\nThe good news is that in hindsight he realizes his frustration is about him and not me doing something to make him frustrated. This doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll never feel that way again, but his realization is a breath of fresh air.\n\nSo if your man gets upset with you whenever you are emotionally vulnerable (sad, anxious/worried, hurt), could it be that he feels totally helpless in the face of your pain? Could it be that his anger is one way he deals with his helplessness?\n\nIf so, this is a great starting point for important discussions.",

    "Therapy is not magic nor is it a process where a therapist is able to \u201cfix\u201d you.  I  sometimes joke with clients that if I had a magic wand under my chair (or on my desk in times of tele-therapy), I could wave it and all would be better.  This certainly would make therapy go faster, wouldn\u2019t it?  Alas, this is not the case. But it\u2019s true that many come to therapy with some preconceived notions of what the process entails and one of the most common fantasies is that their therapist will give them advice.\n\n\u201cJust tell me what to do!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not to say that there are not therapists out there regularly dispensing advice as I believe there are.  But for those who see themselves as a guide for growth and personal empowerment for their clients,  they will refrain.  There are plenty of good reasons why your therapist will likely not give you advice.\n\nYour therapist is not you.\n\nAs much as your therapist delves into the intricacies, characters and emotional waves of your life, they are not in that life.  You share a sacred space together to do your work but he or she is not walking in the footsteps of your day to day.\n\nYour therapist is not wiser than you.  \n\nAnother common misconception is that therapists have perfect mistake-free lives and surely must be more wise.  This is not true.  Therapists are humans too and can have similar challenges.  Keep in mind it also can be much easier to guide another person than see through your own forest.  Yes, therapists train to hold their professions and likely know more than you about relationship dynamics, depression, anxiety, trauma and the impact of family of origin issues but they are not inherently wiser.  You are also wise but may simply need help tapping into your own inner wisdom.\n\nYour therapist probably seeks to empower you.\n\nWhatever obstacles have been standing in the way of you creating the positive change you seek, you are in therapy to identify and understand your blocks then move towards their resolution.  The most powerful work happens when you meet all of those markers, your sense of self strengthening along the way.  This road to personal empowerment can\u2019t happen if the therapist gives you all of \u201cthe answers\u201d or tells you what to do.\n\nAdvice giving is not therapy.\n\nThe work of psychotherapy involves training around the complexities of human behavior, need for emotional safety, brain science and many therapeutic modalities that therapists use in their toolbox.  Some are loyal to one paradigm and others more eclectic.  The bottom line is that it\u2019s a journey taken together between therapist and client where trust is established in order for the deeper work to begin.  It is not meant to be a bandaid only but ideally triggering lifelong changes.\n\nIf you\u2019re in therapy or considering it and hoping to get advice, that\u2019s ok.  You\u2019re not the only one.  When I\u2019m asked for advice, I always remind them of the importance of coming to their own conclusions. But of course I will hope to help guide them to that place.   Therapists have a unique vantage point in their close knowledge of their clients without the emotional entanglements of literally being in their lives.  They are trained to see seek to understand your whole picture with curiosity, gently leading you to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you\u2019re in anywhere in California, learn more about my California Online Therapy and Counseling practice.  If you\u2019re outside of California, I also provide one-time consultations for specific issues that are psycho-educational and not to be considered psychotherapy.",
    "I couldn\u2019t agree more. \n\nI\u2019m not an addiction specialist nor am I here to judge. I\u2019m a registered psychotherapist, conscious parent, and someone who\u2019s benefited tremendously from sharing a substance-free relationship for several years. \n\nFor some, it\u2019s a slippery slope between drinking casually and using it as a coping mechanism. I remember the day I made the decision not to drink alcohol anymore. I never considered myself to be an alcoholic, although I definitely went overboard on a few occasions. When I told my husband I needed a drink after a long snow day alone with the kids, it scared me. \n\nBesides the pain and trauma caused by addiction in my own family tree, I\u2019ve heard countless stories about the devastating effects of alcohol on individuals and families. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s your family. But in case you feel a little concerned or want to give sobriety a try, here are some benefits and tips to make it easier to maintain sobriety during the holiday season. \n\nCHOOSING SOBRIETY TOGETHER \nWhile I can\u2019t speak for everyone, ever since my husband decided to give up alcohol alongside me, our relationship has only gotten stronger. We helped our children through the uncertainty and loss of the pandemic with vulnerable conversations and \u201cnatural highs,\u201d such as daily walks in nature, family games, and movie nights. There\u2019s more laughter and healing tears in our home now. We\u2019ve supported each other in taking risks and investing in our career dreams. We also started to make more time for our shared value of community involvement. \n\nCONSIDER THIS WHEN GOING SOBER\nDon\u2019t think of it as giving anything up. Think about what you all can gain and have fun with it. Increase your water intake (which most of us need to do anyway). Get creative coming up with tasty mocktails and soothing herbal teas.\n\nSupport each other in seeking therapy or other forms of help. If you use alcohol to cope, you may find that underlying grief, trauma, or anxiety can start to surface. Negotiate how to support each other\u2019s needs for healthy coping and daily self-care. Find a Gottman Method-trained therapist near you.\n\nMake a plan for how you will spend the money saved on alcohol. Perhaps you can donate some of it to a cause. You could sponsor others who cannot afford therapy or save for a trip or extra-special date nights. \n\nStand united. Not everyone will understand. You may have to let some people go. Stay focused on the benefits you notice personally and in your relationship. Just know that it\u2019s normal to outgrow some relationships as you continue on your healing and awakening journey. \n\nTIPS FOR HOLIDAY SOBRIETY\nMaintaining sobriety can be especially hard during the holiday season when you can feel pressure from family or colleagues to indulge. Here are some ways to resist peer pressure and honor your commitment.\n\nPrepare yourself. Be prepared for people to notice and ask questions or make assumptions. You can practice your response ahead of time to help you feel more comfortable in claiming your sobriety as a personal choice. You don\u2019t have to go into a long explanation. If people keep trying to pressure you, politely say no thank you and walk away. \n\nManage \u201cFOMO.\u201d You may feel a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d or like you don\u2019t belong anymore, especially if the gatherings have a heavy emphasis on drinking. Root into your reasons for choosing sobriety and celebrate that you are being true to yourself.  You can shorten your visit or suggest an alternative alcohol-free venue to make it a little more manageable.  \n\nTake the spotlight off you. People love to talk about themselves. If you feel especially self-conscious without any \u201cliquid courage,\u201d take a moment to soothe and calm your nervous system by taking some deep breaths. Then as you look around the room, describe three things you like. Next, try asking people questions and focus on really staying present. In this age of distractions, people crave undivided attention. Your genuine interest is a gift they will remember. \n\nTrust that in time it will get easier. If you are the host, let guests know that alcohol will not be provided and that they should bring their own if they want it. You don\u2019t need to feel bad or embarrassed. Our guests sometimes bring alcohol, other times they choose not to drink either. As the years have gone by, each outing and gathering has gotten easier."
